										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Satan Real? Does he exist?<br />
A survey conducted by the Barna Group in 2009 found that 4 out of 10 (40%) Christians in America believed that Satan “is not a living being, but a symbol of evil”. In 2015 66% of American Christians didn’t believe Satan was real.</p>
<p>In a Barna survey in 2020 56% of Americans said “Satan is not merely a symbol of evil but is a real spiritual being and influences human lives.” 49% on the other hand, said they were not entirely sure that God exists.The authors concluded that, “Americans are now more confident about the existence of Satan than they are of God!”</p>
<p>A 2021 Barna survey has found that only 6% American adults possess a Biblical worldview. 88% of Americans cannot be defined by any one predominant worldview. Instead they have a blend of commonly held views (Syncretism: a mixture of different beliefs and worldviews).</p>
<p>Coming back home, Kenya has been called a Christian nation but we can’t ignore the syncretism in our society. We may not have the actual numbers but we can see it. We tend to lionize the devil and see him behind every bush and under every rock and he provides a booming business even in our churches.</p>
<p>Is Satan real? Does he exist?<br />
Satan is fine with either a Yes or No answer depending on who is asking and why. Syncretism will portray Satan on a spectrum from a goofy powerless cartoon character to an all-powerful being – and he is fine with that because many will be deceived. Satan himself is the source of lies. Hollywood has also been a source of much misinformation about Satan.</p>
<p>The Bible says he exists.<br />
Jesus says he exists.<br />
“&#8230;the devil&#8230;was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (John 8:44)</p>
<p>The Bible tells us the truth -about who Satan (the devil) really is – and we can trust that information.<br />
His name, Satan, means “adversary or enemy”<br />
Devil means “false accuser or slanderer”<br />
He’s the tempter (1 Thess 3:5), the evil one (Matt 13:19, 38) the accuser of our brothers (Rev 12:10), the deceiver (Rev 20:3)&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bible also tells us the truth about what Satan is not and what he can’t do.<br />
He is not all powerful, everywhere present or all knowing. He is a created, limited being. He approaches God as a surbodinate (Job 1:6)<br />
He cannot act without permission (see Job).<br />
He cannot force believers to do anything (Acts 26:18)<br />
He does not know the future (Isaiah 46:9-10)<br />
He is a defeated enemy. (Colossians 2:15)<br />
He can be resisted (James 4:7)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is Satan real? Does he exist?<br />
Yes and he is a formidable enemy but the good news is: Greater is He who is in us (1 John 4:4). Jesus has disaramed all powers and authorities. He made a public spectacle of them and triumphed over them by the cross. (Colossians 2:15)</p>
<p>Spiritual warfare is real (Ephesians 6:10-18) and the devil is in the propaganda business but we are not unaware of his schemes (2 Cor 11b) we have the correct information about him (our enemy) and we are fighting from victory.</p>
<p>The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn’t exist. The greatest lie he continues to propagate is that there’s plenty of time to get right with God.</p>
<p>Today as we spend time with God, let’s allow Him to search our hearts to find out if we have allowed worldviews that are in contradiction with the Truth of God’s Word to influence our thinking and belief. Let us trust God to help us so that our faith, utterance and practice will be in tune with God’s Word.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My father is a pastor. When my niece was young, pre-school, he’d tell her, “Finish your tea or you’ll die”. (The things we say to get our kids to hurry up and finish eating). I’m not sure she understood the concept of death; she just knew it was something bad. It went on for a while until one day she responded with a question: “Does God drink tea?”</p>
<p>You could see the theological wheels turning in my father’s brain as he searched for an answer&#8230;If I say Yes, I’ll be lying&#8230;but if I say No&#8230;where will this conversation go&#8230;? He decided to go with “No, God does not drink tea.”</p>
<p>Without missing a beat after swallowing her mouthful of tea, my niece responded, “He’ll die.” Suffice it to say, my dad learned to be more realistic and truthful about his urgings and warnings.</p>
<p>This incident came to mind as I was thinking about truth, who God is and who we believe He is.</p>
<p>It’s been said that we are living in a post-truth world. The Cambridge Dictionary defines “Post-truth” as “relating to a situation in which people are more likely to accept an argument based on their emotions and beliefs, rather than one based on facts.</p>
<p>Many people today, both Christians and non-Christians believe in an (their) idea of Jesus rather than on Jesus Himself. We have this idea of a hippy-make-love-not-war-Jesus or activist-Jesus or my-next-door-buddy-Jesus or my-ATM-Jesus or Fire-fighter-Jesus or safe-Jesus or even put-one-foot-wrong-and-you-are-dead-Jesus. All caricatures; not the real Jesus.</p>
<p>Yet Truth is not an idea or a concept, but a person. Jesus said, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by Me.” (John 14:6) If the Truth is a person, then the only way we can know Truth is through relationship. Truth is not a thing we look for but a Person we get to know, listen to and obey.</p>
<p>Infact Jesus said He came to seek and to save the lost (Luke 19:10). He has done the work. It is finished. But our fallen nature wants to earn its own way into God’s Kingdom. We don’t want to come in through relationship; we want to come in through merit.</p>
<p>Truth can be known, if we are willing to lay down our ideas and meet Him on His own terms.</p>
<p>When Job met Him, his response was: “My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.” (Job 42:5)</p>
<p>When Isaiah met Him, his response was: “Woe to me! I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.” (Isaiah 6:5)</p>
<p>When Peter met Him, his response was: “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” Then he left everything and followed Him. (Luke 5:8, 11)</p>
<p>When Thomas finally “met” Him, his response was: “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28)</p>
<p>What is the starting point of meeting this Jesus?</p>
<p>Jesus said; “Now this is eternal life: that they may know you the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.” (John 17:3)</p>
<p>Jesus is Love, Just, Kind, Meek, Humble, Caring, Compassionate and He is also Righteous, Holy, Lord, Judge and King.<br />
We do well to come to Him on His terms.</p>
<p>This Jesus says:<br />
“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by Me.” (John 14:6)</p>
<p>“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)</p>
<p>“All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.” (John 14:23)</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. (Matthew 10:28)</p>
<p>A.W. Tozer says, “What I believe about God is the most important thing about me.”</p>
<p>What do you believe about God?<br />
What are you basing your beliefs on?<br />
His revelation of Himself or your emotions and personal beliefs?</p>
<p>These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules. (Matthew 15:8-9)</p>
<p>Today as we spend time with in God’s presence, may we embrace true eternal life as we cultivate relationship with the One true God and Jesus Christ, the Truth, whom He has sent.</p>
<p>To all who received Him, to those who believed on His name, He gave the right to become children of God. (John 1:12)<br />
That’s relationship!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been in a place where what the Bible says and your reality seems to be at odds?</p>
<p>And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.” Matt 21:22<br />
I believe&#8230;why isn’t God answering my prayer?</p>
<p>And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 1 John 5:14<br />
My prayer lines up with God’s will&#8230;why isn’t He answering?</p>
<p>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. James 4:3<br />
If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened&#8230;Psalm 66:18<br />
My motives are pure; my sins are confessed&#8230;why isn’t God answering?</p>
<p>That’s where Job found himself.</p>
<p>He was suffering terribly and God was silent.<br />
It felt like God was punishing him for something&#8230;</p>
<p>His friends were sure he had sinned<br />
Job was certain he hadn’t<br />
Job was the kind of man who offered sacrifices for his children&#8230;just in case they had sinned&#8230;he kept short accounts with God where sin was concerned.</p>
<p>Job took his situation to God&#8230;<br />
I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul (Job 7:11)<br />
Will you never look away from me, or let me alone for an instant? If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why do you make me your target? (Job 7:19-20)<br />
I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul. I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me. (Job 10:1-2)</p>
<p>Job’s words are raw, pouring out his heart and questioning why. He may have even overstepped some boundaries with his words but God was not offended by his honesty. God admonished him for speaking “words without knowledge” (Job 38:1 – 41:34 a long and scary lecture) and Job repented (42:1-6).</p>
<p>God then turns and rebukes Job’s friends “I am angry with you&#8230;because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has&#8230;”</p>
<p>Job never got an answer from God on why he went through such great suffering, but God did wipe Job’s tears at the end. (42:10-16)</p>
<p>We have the privilege of being in the audience as we see what takes place between God and Satan. Job didn’t.</p>
<p>Job had faith; he was asking for a good thing and he hadn’t sinned.</p>
<p>God was actually showing off Job’s uprightness to Satan.</p>
<p>As long as we are on this side of eternity, things will happen.<br />
We may suffer because of the fallenness of the world we live in.<br />
We may suffer as a consequence of our sin or poor choices&#8230;or&#8230;<br />
We may just suffer for reasons unknown to us.</p>
<p>Our peace in suffering comes from knowing that<br />
• our loving God is Sovereign over all that happens to us<br />
• He sees us and is aware of what we are going through<br />
• He has a reason why, which He may choose to let us in on, or not<br />
He is with us and He is not leaving (Hebrews 13:5)</p>
<p>Spending time in God’s Word and seeing how He deals with His people, helps us have faith in His power and goodness. It helps us know His character and reminds us that He is a God that can be trusted.</p>
<p>As you spend time with God today, be honest with Him. If things are going well, rejoice with Him, if things are falling apart, pour out your heart to Him, if you are in a dark valley, tell him. Let Him be your comfort. Let Him be your strong tower. Let Him be your joy and your salvation. He will wipe away your tears&#8230;now or later&#8230;</p>
<p>These (the heroes of faith) were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect. (Hebrews 11:39-40)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The story is told of six blind men who used their hands to try and figure out what an elephant was.<br />
Leg – It’s a tree<br />
Trunk – It’s a snake<br />
Tail – It’s a piece of old rope<br />
Side – It’s a wall<br />
Tusk – It’s a spear<br />
Ear – It’s a magic carpet</p>
<p>Clearly a misrepresentation of what an elephant is.</p>
<p>Islam (in the Quran) refers to Christians and Jews as “People of the Book” (those who possess monotheistic scriptures), and it is true&#8230;we are People of the Book, but we (Christians) are in danger of becoming “people of the verse”.</p>
<p>Like the blind men in the story, we tend to take verses and run with them not bothering to understand the whole counsel of God. We take a verse and decree and declare it over our lives ignoring the context and everything else that God has said. </p>
<p>And even in our understanding of God, we have been guilty of taking hold of one attribute of God and distorting God’s character because we ignore the totality of who He is.<br />
The “world” has joined in this by deciding that the only attribute of God they are going to embrace is His Love and nothing more.<br />
“God is love! He would never judge anyone or send anyone to hell! That’s not loving!”</p>
<p>Some have chosen to embrace Jesus, but not the Bible – even though it’s the Scriptures that tell us about Jesus.<br />
 &#8220;[You] can live by the Bible or live by Jesus. [You] can&#8217;t do both.&#8221; Frank Schaeffer</p>
<p>And being “People of the Verse”, reading the Book for the first time can be an uncomfortable exercise. Who is this God? Why is there so much violence?</p>
<p>I’m in a Bible reading group and some people left because they were offended by the God portrayed in Scripture. They put God on trial, found Him wanting and passed judgement. He does not deserve to be God. Or as Bart Campolo put it:<br />
 “I cannot worship a God who is not as compassionate as I am.”</p>
<p>The parts of God’s revelation in Scripture are like pieces of a puzzle, they look disjointed until you put the whole puzzle together, then it makes a picture and it makes sense. But we usually make the mistake of picking a piece and running with it or being disappointed by the piece we are holding.</p>
<p>We are not the only ones who miss it. The disciples missed it. Although Jesus’ accomplished His mission to save them from sin, and usher in the kingdom of God, they kept hoping He would overthrow the Roman government. They did not understand why He came.<br />
“Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel? (Acts 1:6)<br />
Their expectations were not met.</p>
<p>John the Baptist, filled with the Holy Spirit, from his mother’s womb, heard God (audibly) set his seal of approval on Jesus after baptizing Him (Matthew 3:13-17), missed it.</p>
<p>When he was jailed by Herod, he sent his disciples to ask Jesus if He was the “One” or they should look for another. He couldn’t figure out why Jesus hadn’t overthrown the evil Roman government [and got him out of jail]. (Matthew 11:3) His expectations were not met.</p>
<p>Jesus’ response is very telling, “Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.” (Matthew 11:6)<br />
Life may not make sense, but trust who you know that I am.<br />
Things may not go as you desire, but trust in My sovereignty.</p>
<p>John would later be beheaded by Herod. John had accomplished his mission on earth: to prepare the way for Jesus. And Jesus honoured John’s life and ministry. (Matthew 11:11-15)</p>
<p>God is not arbitrary. He is Sovereign and He is good.</p>
<p>Are you making assumptions about God based on skewed reading of the Bible?<br />
Are you uncomfortable with truths you have come across in Scripture?<br />
Have you put God on trial?<br />
Don’t pass judgement on Him just yet&#8230;</p>
<p>Don’t be in a rush<br />
Sit in the discomfort&#8230;<br />
Wrestle with it</p>
<p>Get the whole picture<br />
Get to know God<br />
God has revealed Himself through His word and it can only be understood in its entirety. Read the Bible and look for God. You’ll find Him.</p>
<p>The truth will set you free, even if it makes you miserable at first.</p>
<p> “If you believe what you like in the Gospel, and reject what you don&#8217;t like, it is not the Gospel you believe, but yourself.”― Augustine</p>
<p>Today as you spend time with God, delve into His Word. He wants to be known.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In our discipleship program at RoG Church, we have been taking a closer look at the Spiritual Disciplines. A few weeks ago, we went through the Discipline of study and one of the concepts that was new to most of us was the study of non-verbal books. It’s the least recognized but perhaps the most important field of study. This includes but not limited to study of nature, human beings, events, cultures etc.</p>



<p>Isaiah 55:12 for instance tells us that ‘. . .&nbsp;<em>the mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands</em>.’ The handiwork of the creator can speak to us and teach us if we listen.</p>



<p>Often, we give take home assignments and on this particular subject, one of the tasks was to study a plant and draw lessons from it. As I was doing the marking, I received some amazing responses and insights. Allow me to share two of those:</p>



<p><strong>Student X: The bamboo plant</strong></p>



<p>-How it grows: Plant a cutting. The shoot emerges out of the ground and grows in height and diameter for around 60 days and produces limbs and leaves, then stops to grow in height and diameter after the 60 day period.</p>



<p>-Bamboo being a colony plant uses energy from existing plants to produce more plants and expand the root structure.</p>



<p>-The bamboo takes about 3 years to get established, then continues to get bigger from year to year as the colony grows towards maturity.</p>



<p>-Maturity duration varies depending on species selection, soil, sunlight, climate and watering condition.</p>



<p>-Before bamboo plant grows tall and large, the roots underground must finish growing.</p>



<p>Lessons the bamboo plant has taught me as a believer</p>



<ol><li><em>The foundations and conditions determine growth hence it’s important to keep watch on the doctrines to ensure they are sound and based on the Word of God, if at all we are to grow in God.</em></li><li><em>It takes time investing ourselves in the Word of God to attain maturity, this calls for patience and not giving up.</em></li><li><em>We are called to grow and reproduce just as bamboo uses energy from existing plant to produce more plants.</em></li><li><em>Maturity duration/periods vary from one Christian to the other depending on the environment one exposes themselves to.</em></li></ol>



<p><strong>Student Y</strong></p>



<p>I studied a beautiful Lillie at our flower bed. Its flowers are white and as they blossom, they brighten the garden making it bright with some level of charm that also infuses some calm.</p>



<p>What I learned.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>1. The plant is a work of God</em></p>



<p><em>&nbsp; 2. It never worries about its tomorrow</em></p>



<p><em>&nbsp; 3. Its flowers sprout and die so that it can grow fresh ones. As a Christian, I have to keep dying to self and allow myself to be recreated into the image of God as I go through the seasons of life. The output will be beautiful and it will result in&nbsp;an&nbsp;infusion of rest and calmness.</em></p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>.</p>



<p>For the Christian, the primary focus of our study is Scripture. Psalm 1:1 reminds us ‘<em>Blessed is the man who meditates on the law of the LORD, day and night</em>.’ We can also use good Christian literature and benefit from the labors of others. In addition to written books, we can pay close attention to ‘non-verbal’ books. Psalm 19 directs us to the&nbsp;<em>wonders of creations as they display God’s glory</em>; in Proverbs 30 we are urged to&nbsp;<em>consider ‘ants, locusts, in the pursuit of wisdom</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take time to study nature,or events or human behaviors and see how much you&#8217;ll learn. For instance, pay attention to nature and see the mysteries of God displayed, study&nbsp;relationships between human beings and see for example how our speech is almost always aimed at justifying our actions because of pride and fear. You will realize that more often than not, you behave more like the Pharisees who would pray, “<em>God I thank thee that I am not like other men</em>.” At this point, make yourself the principal object of study and ask the Lord to deliver you from a haughty spirit.</p>



<p>Every blessing,</p>



<p>Peter Muuo. </p>

<p></p>



<p>In 1<sup>st</sup>
Samuel 23: 1-4, David receives news that the country of Keilah was under attack
from the Philistine army. The Philistine army had maliciously attacked and
overpowered Keilah and as a result, they stated looting Keilah’s threshing
floors. Therefore, David did what every Christian believer does, or should do,
when they are under an attack from the enemy; he prayed and inquired of the
Lord. In Vs 2, he asks the Lord, “shall I go and attack these philistines?” and
the Lord answered him and said, “Go, attack the philistines and save Keilah.” </p>



<p>Therefore,
David, full of zeal went and told the 400 men, who had joined him in exile,
what the Lord had just confirmed to him, the victory that they would receive
after they went on a rescue mission to save Keilah from the hand of the
Philistine army. The men were so griped by fear of the “new mission” that David
had told them about that they decided to voice their concern regarding the
danger they faced. </p>



<p>Unfortunately,
they got David’s attention. In Vs 4, David goes back to the Lord to inquire a
second time if He really was going to give them victory if they went up against
the philistine army. </p>



<p>You see,
David only needed a doubtful voice to reach his ear for his faith to be waivered.</p>



<p>As
believers, we always fall victim to this kind of situation. God, by His grace
and love for us, does speak to us through His word, His servants and even in
prayer. He more often than not assures us that we are covered, protected,
blessed, healed and even accepted. Sadly, the people whom we have allowed to be
around us, can sometimes be used of the enemy to bring doubt and crush the
faith that enables us to trust in what God has said about us or to us.</p>



<p>It is good
we allow around us friends who will constantly uplift our faith and help us
grow in our Christian salvation and relationship with God, rather than have
them take us away from God and away from Gods promises and blessings.</p>



<p>Pastor John Hinga.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br></p>



<p>The
devil is seriously waging war on the body of Christ, that is why in 1 Peter 5:8
the bible warns us to- “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil,
as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour”. I am considering
this topic in the wake of Ekeza Sacco scandal in which Bishop. David Kariuki
Ngari alias ‘<em>Gakuyo</em>’ is alleged to
have siphoned Kshs.1.5 billion from the members. </p>



<p>Hardly
a month before, award winning and popular gospel music artists DK Kwenye Beat
and Hopekid were involved in a most scandalous
sex escapade with a young girl; DK was particularly accused of spreading STIs
instead of the gospel. In the recent past the gospel industry has been
especially dogged with many scandals roping in the likes of Willy Paul, Bahati
who succeeded to make the term ‘prayer-partner’ to be a synonym of sex
partner.&nbsp; The phrase may no longer be
used in church anymore because of the unholy connotation it now carries. </p>



<p>When a person becomes famous
for a good and honourable thing in the Kingdom of God; when he builds an
identifiable brand-name and when he makes a significantly large amount in
fortune, then: &nbsp;he needs to become extra
vigilant because there is a fierce lion at his door steps with non-other on earth
to equal him in power. This spiritual lion is perpetually in motion. The day and
night are both alike to him and he has no measure in his furry. When a famous
gospel artist, great worship leader or a crowd pulling and charismatic pastor
are unsuspectingly busking in the fleeting glory of their fame and money; the
lion springs upon them with the object of devouring both the body and the soul
(John 10:10). </p>



<p>The mechanism of their
vulnerability is simple: Money and fame does things to people that make them to
think that life is all about them. We are all vulnerable to this seduction so
much so that I can confidently say that all the above mentioned people had very
noble intentions in the beginning. Over time however, the lion pounded with the
claws of seducing fame and because the pounding does not have real physical
pain at the beginning; they fell victim to the weight of their own fame without
knowing. So much has been the devils influence that in some cases we can say
that the person who was there at the beginning has long since died.</p>



<p>The poignant question is how a poor sinner, who has been carried captive by Satan the roaring lion at his will is to escape out of the snare? After feeding the crowd, Jesus was also pressured by his followers to become King and he fled (John 6:15), he understood it to be Satan’s schemes. In James 4: 7-10 the bible says, “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.” The imperative of the above message to those that have fallen is that they should confess their sins, repent before God of heaven and seek to be forgiven also by their victims. Then in humility go for counselling and accept to be discipled over a reasonable period of time. Then, as God in his sovereign will touches them with healing (with the testimony of transformation from believers in their congregation) they can go back to ministry in their platforms of calling. Failure to which, their further ministry activity will change the way the gospel is seen and will be subjected to ridicule on their account.<br><br><em>Pastor. Davies Kelmen </em></p>

<p class="font_9">It&#8217;s said that silence in the face of evil is evil itself. Not to speak is to speak &amp; not to act is to act. Today, I have been pondering on the current state of affairs in our society and how things have been going south, more specifically with the recent murders. I&#8217;ve been following these stories very closely but today the Lord rebuked me and asked me,what have you done about it? Then as if to argue with Him, I responded, what would I have done? To my amazement, the answer was simple, &#8220;you have been talking about it, sometimes passing judgement but you&#8217;ve never taken time to pray about it.&#8221; I was astonished! I asked God to forgive me and I rem while at the traffic in a matatu, I mentioned the names of all those I could remember, those who have been implicated in one way or the other. I asked that the fear of God would come and grip their hearts and cause them to turn from their ways and follow Christ. Of course, they will still face the consequences of their actions, but for sure, their souls will be saved at the end of time and their testimony will probably lead many other people to salvation.</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Afterwards I felt great relief and thanked God. Now, this might sound absurd but let me bring the point closer home. God says in His Word that in the last days evil will increase. Basically, what we know is that things won&#8217;t get any better. We have our siblings,family, children(or aspiring to have) etc. Let me use the children. Our kids or kids to be will be born to this merciless, cruel, world. If things are bad now, they will be worse in years to come. Wait until the day that such kind of an evil hits your child(GOD FORBID) and that&#8217;s when you will realize the relevance of my prayers today.I want to employ each one of you reading this post. The Bible says, &#8220;the Just shall live by FAITH.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t matter the evil around, the righteous ones will always live because of their Faith in God. Ps 91 speaks about some of the blessings of those who make the Lord their shelter. v7 &#8220;Though a thousand fall at your side, though ten thousand are dying around you, these evils will not touch you.&#8221; Friends, we have a choice today, to go on our knees for our generation.</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Remember, God could have saved Sodom &amp; Gomorrah if He had found just one righteous person. Your prayers and righteousness before God have the potential to turn things around. . You can be the voice that spares your family members from the tragedy that the devil has planned against them.We have a choice to pray that God will preserve them as they come and live in this world that the enemy will not touch them. We have a choice to pray that the fear of the Lord will grip the hearts of men and that perpetrators of evil will come to the saving knowledge of Christ. Friends, we have a choice. You have a choice to panic,complain,fear etc but you also have a choice to pray and make a difference. Prayer works. I employ you to spare some moments and pray for these issues and other issues surrounding your life. James 5:16[NLT], &#8220;The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results.&#8221;</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Make the right choice!</p>

<p class="font_9">In our Bible study, we have been studying the Israelites pilgrimage from Egypt to the promised land. There are many things that we have continued to learn but one thing that has stood out for us is how they had mastered to perfection the art of murmuring. How is it, you ask, that a nation so blessed as Israel could still complain against God? The answer is right before you, ask yourself the same question. Sadly, most people are murmurers(complainers,grumblers), at home,work,school,- everywhere and anytime, there’s always loads of opportunities to grumble. Murmuring is not always verbal, it’s more so in our minds. Murmuring is a sin (Prov 19:3, 17:19) that arises from the fleshly nature of our hearts and it robs us of God’s blessings and grace. For the Israelites, it cost them dearly (Read through Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers and see)</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">The Chronicles of Israel’s murmuring.</p>
<ol class="font_8">
<li>
<p class="font_9">They complained to Moses that because of his talk of a promised land, Pharaoh had made things difficult for them Exodus 5:20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">When pursued by Pharaoh at the Red sea, they complained to Moses that it was better if he had left them alone in Egypt Exodus 14:10-12</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">After experiencing God’s deliverance at the Red sea,  and now at the desert of Shur at a place called Marah, they complained about the bitter water Exodus 15:22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">At the desert of Sin, they complained about being hungry Exodus 16:1-4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">At Rephidin, they complained about being thirsty Exodus 17:1-4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">At the desert of Paran after leaving Sinai, the people complained about their hardships. God sent fire from heaven and consumed the outskirts of the camp. Numbers 11:1-3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The ‘mixed multitude’ amongst the Israelites also complained about not having meat. They said they had lost their appetites because of eating manna continuously-that which previously tasted as honey now tasted like something made with olive oil. Numbers 11:4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Miriam and Aaron complained about Moses’ leadership. Miriam was struck with Leprosy. Numbers 12</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The spies complained about how difficult it was to enter the Promised Land. They died of plague Numbers 14</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The whole assembly wanted to stone Moses Numbers 14:10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Key leaders(Korah,Dathan and Abiran) complained and rebelled against Moses. The ground split open and consumed the rebels. Numbers 16</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">After the episode above, the people complained again accusing Moses of killing God’s people Numbers 16:41</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">At the desert of Zin they complained of thirst and Moses angry with them complained and struck the rock instead of speaking to it. This cost him Canaan. Numbers 20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The people complained to Moses and God once again for taking them out of Egypt. God sent a fiery serpent to bite them Numbers 21:4-5</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="font_9">Even after experiencing God’s blessings, providence,deliverance,presence and even wrath, the Israelites still grumbled. In 1 Corinthians 10:11, we read that ‘their story is recorded for us to learn from their mistakes’.</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">So what causes murmuring even in us today?</p>
<ol class="font_8">
<li>
<p class="font_9">Comparison. For instance, Numbers 11 “We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic”. Looking at this statement, you’d think their life in Egypt was heaven on earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Self-pity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">A false sense of injustice. (A sense that every circumstance is unfair to you)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Pride. (E.g. Miriam &amp; Aaron)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Lack of gratitude</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Unbelief</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Fear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Being judgmental</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Stubbornness and hardness of heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Lust</p>
<p class="font_9">
</li>
</ol>

<p class="font_9">My name is Peter Muuo, of course many of you reading this know that. I am one of those persons who really value their reputation. I will do everything possible to safeguard my image. Recently as we were commuting home, my wife offered me a drink of porridge which I quickly turned down. It was a simple No, thanks! She wasn’t shocked, as she would later confirm to me that her gesture was just an act of  kindness, otherwise having known me for quite some time now, she knew beforehand that I wasn’t going to accept her offer[Me, taking porridge, in a matatu!No way!]. Mind you, not that anyone would have noticed.</p>
<p class="font_9">This need to feel dignified might not necessarily be a bad thing, but if not put in check, I acknowledge that it can puff me up in many ways and to admit it, it has, in several occasions. For instance, it was so bad at some point in my life that I only desired to be associated with the high and mighty, only those that I could gain something from in return(E.g. fame by hanging out with celebrities, financial benefits etc.). The Lord seriously rebuked me through my wife (fiancé then), [story for another day] and now by the grace of God, I daily ask God to help me appreciate everyone that comes into my life and treat them equally.</p>
<p class="font_9">Pride is a snare that the devil has used successfully since the creation of the world to bring destruction upon people. John Hagee quotes, “Pride is like a poisonous weed that grows in any soil without need of water or care.” No one is immune from it, it’s like a cancer that kills everyone and everything it touches.</p>
<p class="font_9">Our text from Proverbs 16:18 goes on to say, “Pride goes before destruction,<br />
a haughty spirit before a fall.” Pride always precedes destruction and a great fall.</p>
<p class="font_9">What is Pride and what causes it?</p>
<p class="font_9">Among other things, pride is first and foremost a spirit, [read v.18b—a haughty spirit]. It lifts us up so that we look down on someone or people just because we feel we are better than them. The source of this spirit is the devil himself. It was because of pride that him and the fallen angels were thrown out of heaven [Isaiah 14:12-15, Rev 12:7-12] He fell because of pride that originated from his desire to be God instead of a servant of God. Satan was the highest of all the angels [Ez 28:12-19], but he wasn’t happy. He desired to be God and rule the universe. God cast Satan out of heaven as a fallen angel.</p>
<p class="font_9">Pride is the spiritual power behind broken families, churches, governments and the society at large. Marriages break up mainly because of pride(No one is willing to admit their mistake); the body of Christ is sharply divided because we don’t embrace each other(some denominations feel superior than others, some pastors preach messages that are only meant to attract followers[&amp; sycophants] to build their reputation rather than preaching what’s true and to win souls.)</p>
<p class="font_9">Secondly, I’d say that pride is deeply rooted in idolatry- It causes people to worship themselves (e.g. Have you seen people who worship their beauty?), worship others, their possessions and abilities etc.  It makes people think that they are self-sufficient and that they don’t need no one, not even God, because they themselves have become gods. I have sometimes read about some people who call themselves gods because they pride themselves in their wealth &amp; abilities. Pharaoh is a perfect example. In Exodus 5:2, he asks Moses, “Who is the Lord? And why should I listen to Him? I don’t know the Lord and I will not let Israel go”. The rich fool in Luke 12:13-21, beat his chest for having plenty, he thought he now held the keys to his life &amp; future. God took his life that very night.</p>
<p class="font_9">More examples in the Bible</p>
<p class="font_9">There are endless examples in scripture about people who became proud and ended in destruction. I’ve mentioned some above, let’s see a few more:</p>
<ol class="font_8">
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s pride that caused Adam &amp; Eve to sin against God. Eve desired wisdom (to become like God) and that’s why she ate the fruit in the first place. When God confronted them with their sin, they couldn’t help but blame each other instead of simply accepting responsibility for their actions. In fact at one point Adam blamed God for creating the woman and giving her to him. [Seriously!!]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s pride that caused Cain to kill Abel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s pride that sent king Nebuchadnezzar to the fields to eat grass for 7 years while he should have been in his palace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s pride that orchestrated the downfall of most Kings of Israel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s this same spirit that caused the Israelites to worship other Gods. (Remember the warning in Deuteronomy 8 “Beware in your plenty that you do not forget the Lord your God). But they often forgot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s the self-righteous pride of the Pharisees that made them not accept the testimony of Jesus, ultimately crucifying him on the cross.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It was by the same spirit that one of the thieves on the cross blatantly refused the supremacy of Jesus Christ (Luke 23:39). Even today, this Spirit is at work causing people to deny even the existence of Christ.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="font_9">I do not know where you are at in your life. As I mentioned earlier, pride is a serious destroyer and all of us are her candidates. In our arrogant pride we are telling God that we don’t need Him. Working on pride is not a day’s activity, it’s a life time event that involves the daily work of the Holy Spirit. Has it touched your life, family, church? Allow God through His Holy Spirit to get it out now because your very spiritual survival is at stake. Remember that no proud man/woman can stand before God. James 4:6.  “And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” I need this grace, we all do. Let’s say a prayer together:</p>
<p class="font_9">Father in Heaven, I thank you for your Word that has reminded me today that pride is a dangerous poison. Forgive me Lord when I have allowed it to ruin my life, my family, my work and my relationship with you. Father I ask for your grace that is freely available to all, to rest on me today, to help me live a life of humility before God and men. I acknowledge that the process of teaching me humility may not be a sweet one, but dear Lord, I am ready, for I know that you chasten those that you love. So help me God, and let your Holy Spirit richly dwell in my life. In Jesus Name I pray.</p>
