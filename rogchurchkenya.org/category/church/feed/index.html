										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My father is a pastor. When my niece was young, pre-school, he’d tell her, “Finish your tea or you’ll die”. (The things we say to get our kids to hurry up and finish eating). I’m not sure she understood the concept of death; she just knew it was something bad. It went on for a while until one day she responded with a question: “Does God drink tea?”</p>
<p>You could see the theological wheels turning in my father’s brain as he searched for an answer&#8230;If I say Yes, I’ll be lying&#8230;but if I say No&#8230;where will this conversation go&#8230;? He decided to go with “No, God does not drink tea.”</p>
<p>Without missing a beat after swallowing her mouthful of tea, my niece responded, “He’ll die.” Suffice it to say, my dad learned to be more realistic and truthful about his urgings and warnings.</p>
<p>This incident came to mind as I was thinking about truth, who God is and who we believe He is.</p>
<p>It’s been said that we are living in a post-truth world. The Cambridge Dictionary defines “Post-truth” as “relating to a situation in which people are more likely to accept an argument based on their emotions and beliefs, rather than one based on facts.</p>
<p>Many people today, both Christians and non-Christians believe in an (their) idea of Jesus rather than on Jesus Himself. We have this idea of a hippy-make-love-not-war-Jesus or activist-Jesus or my-next-door-buddy-Jesus or my-ATM-Jesus or Fire-fighter-Jesus or safe-Jesus or even put-one-foot-wrong-and-you-are-dead-Jesus. All caricatures; not the real Jesus.</p>
<p>Yet Truth is not an idea or a concept, but a person. Jesus said, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by Me.” (John 14:6) If the Truth is a person, then the only way we can know Truth is through relationship. Truth is not a thing we look for but a Person we get to know, listen to and obey.</p>
<p>Infact Jesus said He came to seek and to save the lost (Luke 19:10). He has done the work. It is finished. But our fallen nature wants to earn its own way into God’s Kingdom. We don’t want to come in through relationship; we want to come in through merit.</p>
<p>Truth can be known, if we are willing to lay down our ideas and meet Him on His own terms.</p>
<p>When Job met Him, his response was: “My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.” (Job 42:5)</p>
<p>When Isaiah met Him, his response was: “Woe to me! I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.” (Isaiah 6:5)</p>
<p>When Peter met Him, his response was: “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” Then he left everything and followed Him. (Luke 5:8, 11)</p>
<p>When Thomas finally “met” Him, his response was: “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28)</p>
<p>What is the starting point of meeting this Jesus?</p>
<p>Jesus said; “Now this is eternal life: that they may know you the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.” (John 17:3)</p>
<p>Jesus is Love, Just, Kind, Meek, Humble, Caring, Compassionate and He is also Righteous, Holy, Lord, Judge and King.<br />
We do well to come to Him on His terms.</p>
<p>This Jesus says:<br />
“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by Me.” (John 14:6)</p>
<p>“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)</p>
<p>“All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.” (John 14:23)</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. (Matthew 10:28)</p>
<p>A.W. Tozer says, “What I believe about God is the most important thing about me.”</p>
<p>What do you believe about God?<br />
What are you basing your beliefs on?<br />
His revelation of Himself or your emotions and personal beliefs?</p>
<p>These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules. (Matthew 15:8-9)</p>
<p>Today as we spend time with in God’s presence, may we embrace true eternal life as we cultivate relationship with the One true God and Jesus Christ, the Truth, whom He has sent.</p>
<p>To all who received Him, to those who believed on His name, He gave the right to become children of God. (John 1:12)<br />
That’s relationship!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been in a place where what the Bible says and your reality seems to be at odds?</p>
<p>And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.” Matt 21:22<br />
I believe&#8230;why isn’t God answering my prayer?</p>
<p>And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 1 John 5:14<br />
My prayer lines up with God’s will&#8230;why isn’t He answering?</p>
<p>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. James 4:3<br />
If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened&#8230;Psalm 66:18<br />
My motives are pure; my sins are confessed&#8230;why isn’t God answering?</p>
<p>That’s where Job found himself.</p>
<p>He was suffering terribly and God was silent.<br />
It felt like God was punishing him for something&#8230;</p>
<p>His friends were sure he had sinned<br />
Job was certain he hadn’t<br />
Job was the kind of man who offered sacrifices for his children&#8230;just in case they had sinned&#8230;he kept short accounts with God where sin was concerned.</p>
<p>Job took his situation to God&#8230;<br />
I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul (Job 7:11)<br />
Will you never look away from me, or let me alone for an instant? If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why do you make me your target? (Job 7:19-20)<br />
I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul. I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me. (Job 10:1-2)</p>
<p>Job’s words are raw, pouring out his heart and questioning why. He may have even overstepped some boundaries with his words but God was not offended by his honesty. God admonished him for speaking “words without knowledge” (Job 38:1 – 41:34 a long and scary lecture) and Job repented (42:1-6).</p>
<p>God then turns and rebukes Job’s friends “I am angry with you&#8230;because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has&#8230;”</p>
<p>Job never got an answer from God on why he went through such great suffering, but God did wipe Job’s tears at the end. (42:10-16)</p>
<p>We have the privilege of being in the audience as we see what takes place between God and Satan. Job didn’t.</p>
<p>Job had faith; he was asking for a good thing and he hadn’t sinned.</p>
<p>God was actually showing off Job’s uprightness to Satan.</p>
<p>As long as we are on this side of eternity, things will happen.<br />
We may suffer because of the fallenness of the world we live in.<br />
We may suffer as a consequence of our sin or poor choices&#8230;or&#8230;<br />
We may just suffer for reasons unknown to us.</p>
<p>Our peace in suffering comes from knowing that<br />
• our loving God is Sovereign over all that happens to us<br />
• He sees us and is aware of what we are going through<br />
• He has a reason why, which He may choose to let us in on, or not<br />
He is with us and He is not leaving (Hebrews 13:5)</p>
<p>Spending time in God’s Word and seeing how He deals with His people, helps us have faith in His power and goodness. It helps us know His character and reminds us that He is a God that can be trusted.</p>
<p>As you spend time with God today, be honest with Him. If things are going well, rejoice with Him, if things are falling apart, pour out your heart to Him, if you are in a dark valley, tell him. Let Him be your comfort. Let Him be your strong tower. Let Him be your joy and your salvation. He will wipe away your tears&#8230;now or later&#8230;</p>
<p>These (the heroes of faith) were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect. (Hebrews 11:39-40)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="font_9">The cover image above depicts a lady who&#8217;s doing everything possible to maintain a firm grip on something that&#8217;s seemingly invaluable to her(In her case a purple pineapple). This is just a simple imagery of what Jesus taught regarding the connection between human beings and their possessions(the temporal things of this world). Jesus knew the grip that material things can have on people which is precisely why He commanded His followers, &#8220;Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth.&#8221;  Don&#8217;t get Him wrong, material things are good, but Jesus was trying to state the plain fact that a man&#8217;s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.</p>
<p class="font_9">1 John 2:15-17 says, “Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. 16 For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world. 17 And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.”</p>
<p class="font_9">Profound, isn’t it? John has told us already that if we walk in sin&#8217;s darkness and claim to be in fellowship with God, we are lying (1 John 1:16). Now John points out a specific area of sin that especially threatens our fellowship with God: worldliness, (To love the world). The world, in the sense John means it here, is not the global earth, nor is it the mass of humanity, which God Himself loves according to John 3:16; Instead it is the community of sinful humanity that is united in rebellion against God. God created us and placed us in the world but not to be of the world (John 17:14-18).</p>
<p class="font_9">The passage of 1 John 2:15-17 points out that the character of the world expresses itself through the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. These lusts seek to draw our own flesh away into sin and worldliness. God knows we have a fleshly, bodily nature, and physical needs that feel good when satisfied yet it is not in His nature to influence us wrongly through them. Even though they ‘feel good’ and ‘satisfy’ something within us, God calls it sin. And it is sin that will cause people not to inherit the Kingdom of God. If you love the world, there are rewards to be gained. You may find a place of prestige, of status, of honor, of comfort; for the world system knows how to reward its lovers. At the same time, even at their best, the rewards that come from this world last only as long as we live. The problem is that though we gain them, we lose the prestige, status, honor, and comfort of heaven. So God here is calling upon us to hate the world and the things therein.</p>
<p class="font_9">In His book, &#8216;Celebration of Discipline&#8217;, Richard Foster defines the lust of the flesh as the failure to discipline the natural human passions, the lust of the eye as the tendency to be captivated by the outward show and the pride of life as pretentious egoism.” In each case the same thing is seen: infatuation with natural human powers and abilities without any dependence on God  (Richard 2008) .How easy it has become especially in our affluent world to fall into this trap. Many have fallen and sadly, many will not realize this before their time on earth is up. May God help us to observe the strictest daily discipline to hold these passions in check.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our world is certainly in a bad and sorry state. Today, covetousness is praised as ambition, greed admired as being industrious, hoarding commended as prudence, premarital sex and extra martial affairs promoted and commended, drunkenness accommodated  just to mention a few. Sadly, these and other bad practices take place mostly in Christian circles in the name of grace. That is, christians intentionally commit sin knowing that grace got them covered. I used to think this way too. This is a lie! [Shindwe!]</p>
<p class="font_9">Titus 2:11-12 “For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.  It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age.”</p>
<p class="font_9">In our scripture today, the Bible is bringing it out clearly that the grace/salvation we enjoy today is given to all men and every man has the opportunity to know God if they choose to. Yet the work of grace is to prevent us from sinning and draws us closer to God. (Not to excuse sin as the world tries to have it)</p>
<p class="font_9">Grace is expensive!. It cost Jesus His own life. When I remember the pain, agony, mockery, whipping, crown of thorns, the piercing on his stomach, the nails on His hands and legs, the shame of the cross, the miserable death—all this reminds me that grace is not cheap. Just that thought spurs me to live a godly life, because living in sin is ideally taking Jesus back to the cross.</p>
<p class="font_9">So, just because it is free, don’t think for a moment that it won’t cost you something!! That is my definition of grace. Suppose you have a lifelong dream to travel around the world, and someone decides to pay all your bills for that venture __of course, on one hand the trip will be free, you’ll have the time of your life but on the other hand it will cost you something- your time, job, family, friendships and possibly your own life etc. So it is with grace. On the one hand it is a free and undeserved gift, on the other hand, it costs you everything- It requires that I become a disciple of Jesus, loving him more than anything, even my own life and obeying Him faithfully. (Read more in my previous article, Fan or Disciple of Jesus Christ)</p>
<p class="font_9">Fellow brothers &amp; sisters in Christ, let’s repent of the many instances when we have abused the grace of our Lord Jesus and let’s seek to live faithful, obedient lives that reciprocate His grace for us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="font_9">LUKE 14:25-35</p>
<p class="font_9">V.25 “A large crowd was following Jesus …”</p>
<p class="font_9">This was a typical day in Jesus’ life during His earthly ministry- He had many fans. Some were dazzled by His amazing miracles, others entertained by His captivating miracles, still others were impressed by how cleverly He refuted the challenges of the Pharisees and other religious leaders. Jesus was popular. The Nation was looking for a charismatic leader who would help overthrow the Roman authorities—and here was someone superbly qualified for the task. All He needed to do was flatter them, probably perform a few miracles to win their allegiance etc., but Jesus took the exact opposite approach (Opposite of what most preaching is concerned with today).</p>
<p class="font_9">Instead of majoring in the benefits and blessings, thrills and excitements, Jesus spoke more of the difficulties, the dangers, the sacrifices they’d have to make-to become His disciples. He was not interested in mere quantity, He was looking for men and women of quality. This is what puts a distinction between a fan and a follower. Fans tag along during the good times, watch events from the sidelines but followers of Jesus proactively pursue becoming like their Master in every way. No wonder Jesus gave the command to His disciples to “Go and make ‘Disciples’ of all nations. (Matthew 28:19). Note that He didn’t tell them to go and make church goers, Christians, believers-He was specific, Disciples. “It is not without significance that the word disciple occurs in the new testament 269 times, Christian only 3 times and believers 2 times” (Sanders 1994)</p>
<p class="font_9">Jesus continues to have many fans today. The church is full of people who see Jesus as their quick-fix solution to their troubled marriages, financial difficulties, health problems etc. Similarly the church is full of many preachers whose gospel is about blessings, money, healing, wealth and health thus attracting many fans. As my pastor would put it, “The gospel of Jesus Christ is not about shillings and cents, it’s about heaven and hell, righteousness and unrighteousness.” True to this proclamation, I submit to you that Jesus is engaged in a serious agenda of destroying the Kingdom of darkness &amp; He doesn’t desire to be associated with people who will slow down His agenda or who will turn back when the fighting grows fierce.</p>
<p class="font_9">When you made that decision to follow Christ, did you count the cost?</p>
<p class="font_9">God bless you!</p>

<p class="font_9">To grow in Christ-likeness signifies we must grow in Christ-like attributes. One of His attributes is this, “He is entirely faithful.” Psalms 89:8(b); and He’s calling us to become increasingly faithful to Him and others. Moreover, Faithfulness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit which ought to be evident in every believer&#8217;s life. Is it possible to have for instance; faithful servants of Christ?, government officers who are courageous enough to say no to compromises?, men &amp; women who are faithful to their partners despite the perverseness around? Young people who can abstain until marriage? Employees who are faithful to their bosses? Etc.  The question I find asking myself today is, Can God really count on me? even when it costs me something?</p>
<p class="font_9">JEREMIAH 35:1-19- THE RECHABITES</p>
<p class="font_9">In Jeremiah 35:1-19, we see a people group that God described as Faithful, The Rechabites. The Rechabites (also Recabites, Rekabites) were a nomadic people group known for their strict rules to abstain from wine, from building houses, from sowing seed, and from planting vineyards (Jeremiah 35:6–7). They were faithful to abide by these rules through the generations, all the way from the time of King Jehu (2 Kings 10:15) to the time of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 35:8–10)—over 200 years, While the rest of the nation was breaking its covenant before God.</p>
<p>They were descendants of Rechab (or Recab or Rekab), a Kenite and thus related to the Midianites and Moses’ family by marriage (see Judges 1:16). According to Jeremiah 35:6, the Rechabites’ strict rules were put in place by a son (or descendant) of Rechab named Jehonadab (or Jonadab). This is the same Jehonadab who helped Jehu rid Israel of Baal-worship after the time of Ahab (2 Kings 10:15–27). For 200 years, the Recabites had obeyed their ancestor’s vow to abstain from wine, they were steadfast in their commitment.</p>
<p class="font_9">God desired that the rest of the people would remain as committed to their covenant with Him as the Recabites were to their vow. God had Jeremiah tempt the Recabites with wine to demonstrate their dedication and commitment as a lesson to the rest of the people of Israel. God knew that they wouldn’t break their vow. (Would God have such confidence in you?)</p>
<p class="font_9">There is a vivid contrast between the Recabites and other Israelites:-</p>
<ol class="font_8">
<li>
<p class="font_9">The Recabites had obeyed for hundreds of years; the Israelites had disobeyed for hundreds of years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">They kept their vows to a fallible human leader; the Israelites broke their covenant with their infallible divine leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Jehonadab told his family only once not to drink wine and they obeyed; God repeatedly commanded Israel to turn from sin and they refused</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The Recabites obeyed laws that dealt with temporal issues; Israel refused to obey God’s laws that dealt with eternal issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The Recabites were rewarded v19; the Israelites would be punished.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="font_9">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="font_9">Friends, it’s unfortunate that most of us are faithful only to the degree that it’s advantageous to us or to the degree that someone is keeping an eye on us. Beyond that, most people are never willing to go the distance. Christ was faithful to the Father even to the point of death on the cross. This is the same attitude we should embrace first to God, then to others, in all aspects of our lives. Faithfulness will be rewarded in this life and in eternity. Just like Jehonadab was rewarded with descendants who served God, we too shall be rewarded greatly if we remain steadfast. “To the faithful, He shows Himself faithful, to those with integrity, He shows integrity.” Psalm 18:25</p>
<p class="font_9">Consider Matthew 25:21 His master replied, &#8216;Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!&#8217;” Personally, these are the words I desire to hear from my Master Jesus. How about you?</p>
<p class="font_9">I call upon you to examine your life and ask the Lord to create a loyal/steadfast spirit within you, a spirit willing to obey Him.</p>
<p class="font_9">Blessings,</p>
<p class="font_9">Muuo</p>
