										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Satan Real? Does he exist?<br />
A survey conducted by the Barna Group in 2009 found that 4 out of 10 (40%) Christians in America believed that Satan “is not a living being, but a symbol of evil”. In 2015 66% of American Christians didn’t believe Satan was real.</p>
<p>In a Barna survey in 2020 56% of Americans said “Satan is not merely a symbol of evil but is a real spiritual being and influences human lives.” 49% on the other hand, said they were not entirely sure that God exists.The authors concluded that, “Americans are now more confident about the existence of Satan than they are of God!”</p>
<p>A 2021 Barna survey has found that only 6% American adults possess a Biblical worldview. 88% of Americans cannot be defined by any one predominant worldview. Instead they have a blend of commonly held views (Syncretism: a mixture of different beliefs and worldviews).</p>
<p>Coming back home, Kenya has been called a Christian nation but we can’t ignore the syncretism in our society. We may not have the actual numbers but we can see it. We tend to lionize the devil and see him behind every bush and under every rock and he provides a booming business even in our churches.</p>
<p>Is Satan real? Does he exist?<br />
Satan is fine with either a Yes or No answer depending on who is asking and why. Syncretism will portray Satan on a spectrum from a goofy powerless cartoon character to an all-powerful being – and he is fine with that because many will be deceived. Satan himself is the source of lies. Hollywood has also been a source of much misinformation about Satan.</p>
<p>The Bible says he exists.<br />
Jesus says he exists.<br />
“&#8230;the devil&#8230;was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (John 8:44)</p>
<p>The Bible tells us the truth -about who Satan (the devil) really is – and we can trust that information.<br />
His name, Satan, means “adversary or enemy”<br />
Devil means “false accuser or slanderer”<br />
He’s the tempter (1 Thess 3:5), the evil one (Matt 13:19, 38) the accuser of our brothers (Rev 12:10), the deceiver (Rev 20:3)&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bible also tells us the truth about what Satan is not and what he can’t do.<br />
He is not all powerful, everywhere present or all knowing. He is a created, limited being. He approaches God as a surbodinate (Job 1:6)<br />
He cannot act without permission (see Job).<br />
He cannot force believers to do anything (Acts 26:18)<br />
He does not know the future (Isaiah 46:9-10)<br />
He is a defeated enemy. (Colossians 2:15)<br />
He can be resisted (James 4:7)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is Satan real? Does he exist?<br />
Yes and he is a formidable enemy but the good news is: Greater is He who is in us (1 John 4:4). Jesus has disaramed all powers and authorities. He made a public spectacle of them and triumphed over them by the cross. (Colossians 2:15)</p>
<p>Spiritual warfare is real (Ephesians 6:10-18) and the devil is in the propaganda business but we are not unaware of his schemes (2 Cor 11b) we have the correct information about him (our enemy) and we are fighting from victory.</p>
<p>The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn’t exist. The greatest lie he continues to propagate is that there’s plenty of time to get right with God.</p>
<p>Today as we spend time with God, let’s allow Him to search our hearts to find out if we have allowed worldviews that are in contradiction with the Truth of God’s Word to influence our thinking and belief. Let us trust God to help us so that our faith, utterance and practice will be in tune with God’s Word.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The story is told of six blind men who used their hands to try and figure out what an elephant was.<br />
Leg – It’s a tree<br />
Trunk – It’s a snake<br />
Tail – It’s a piece of old rope<br />
Side – It’s a wall<br />
Tusk – It’s a spear<br />
Ear – It’s a magic carpet</p>
<p>Clearly a misrepresentation of what an elephant is.</p>
<p>Islam (in the Quran) refers to Christians and Jews as “People of the Book” (those who possess monotheistic scriptures), and it is true&#8230;we are People of the Book, but we (Christians) are in danger of becoming “people of the verse”.</p>
<p>Like the blind men in the story, we tend to take verses and run with them not bothering to understand the whole counsel of God. We take a verse and decree and declare it over our lives ignoring the context and everything else that God has said. </p>
<p>And even in our understanding of God, we have been guilty of taking hold of one attribute of God and distorting God’s character because we ignore the totality of who He is.<br />
The “world” has joined in this by deciding that the only attribute of God they are going to embrace is His Love and nothing more.<br />
“God is love! He would never judge anyone or send anyone to hell! That’s not loving!”</p>
<p>Some have chosen to embrace Jesus, but not the Bible – even though it’s the Scriptures that tell us about Jesus.<br />
 &#8220;[You] can live by the Bible or live by Jesus. [You] can&#8217;t do both.&#8221; Frank Schaeffer</p>
<p>And being “People of the Verse”, reading the Book for the first time can be an uncomfortable exercise. Who is this God? Why is there so much violence?</p>
<p>I’m in a Bible reading group and some people left because they were offended by the God portrayed in Scripture. They put God on trial, found Him wanting and passed judgement. He does not deserve to be God. Or as Bart Campolo put it:<br />
 “I cannot worship a God who is not as compassionate as I am.”</p>
<p>The parts of God’s revelation in Scripture are like pieces of a puzzle, they look disjointed until you put the whole puzzle together, then it makes a picture and it makes sense. But we usually make the mistake of picking a piece and running with it or being disappointed by the piece we are holding.</p>
<p>We are not the only ones who miss it. The disciples missed it. Although Jesus’ accomplished His mission to save them from sin, and usher in the kingdom of God, they kept hoping He would overthrow the Roman government. They did not understand why He came.<br />
“Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel? (Acts 1:6)<br />
Their expectations were not met.</p>
<p>John the Baptist, filled with the Holy Spirit, from his mother’s womb, heard God (audibly) set his seal of approval on Jesus after baptizing Him (Matthew 3:13-17), missed it.</p>
<p>When he was jailed by Herod, he sent his disciples to ask Jesus if He was the “One” or they should look for another. He couldn’t figure out why Jesus hadn’t overthrown the evil Roman government [and got him out of jail]. (Matthew 11:3) His expectations were not met.</p>
<p>Jesus’ response is very telling, “Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.” (Matthew 11:6)<br />
Life may not make sense, but trust who you know that I am.<br />
Things may not go as you desire, but trust in My sovereignty.</p>
<p>John would later be beheaded by Herod. John had accomplished his mission on earth: to prepare the way for Jesus. And Jesus honoured John’s life and ministry. (Matthew 11:11-15)</p>
<p>God is not arbitrary. He is Sovereign and He is good.</p>
<p>Are you making assumptions about God based on skewed reading of the Bible?<br />
Are you uncomfortable with truths you have come across in Scripture?<br />
Have you put God on trial?<br />
Don’t pass judgement on Him just yet&#8230;</p>
<p>Don’t be in a rush<br />
Sit in the discomfort&#8230;<br />
Wrestle with it</p>
<p>Get the whole picture<br />
Get to know God<br />
God has revealed Himself through His word and it can only be understood in its entirety. Read the Bible and look for God. You’ll find Him.</p>
<p>The truth will set you free, even if it makes you miserable at first.</p>
<p> “If you believe what you like in the Gospel, and reject what you don&#8217;t like, it is not the Gospel you believe, but yourself.”― Augustine</p>
<p>Today as you spend time with God, delve into His Word. He wants to be known.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In our discipleship program at RoG Church, we have been taking a closer look at the Spiritual Disciplines. A few weeks ago, we went through the Discipline of study and one of the concepts that was new to most of us was the study of non-verbal books. It’s the least recognized but perhaps the most important field of study. This includes but not limited to study of nature, human beings, events, cultures etc.</p>



<p>Isaiah 55:12 for instance tells us that ‘. . .&nbsp;<em>the mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands</em>.’ The handiwork of the creator can speak to us and teach us if we listen.</p>



<p>Often, we give take home assignments and on this particular subject, one of the tasks was to study a plant and draw lessons from it. As I was doing the marking, I received some amazing responses and insights. Allow me to share two of those:</p>



<p><strong>Student X: The bamboo plant</strong></p>



<p>-How it grows: Plant a cutting. The shoot emerges out of the ground and grows in height and diameter for around 60 days and produces limbs and leaves, then stops to grow in height and diameter after the 60 day period.</p>



<p>-Bamboo being a colony plant uses energy from existing plants to produce more plants and expand the root structure.</p>



<p>-The bamboo takes about 3 years to get established, then continues to get bigger from year to year as the colony grows towards maturity.</p>



<p>-Maturity duration varies depending on species selection, soil, sunlight, climate and watering condition.</p>



<p>-Before bamboo plant grows tall and large, the roots underground must finish growing.</p>



<p>Lessons the bamboo plant has taught me as a believer</p>



<ol><li><em>The foundations and conditions determine growth hence it’s important to keep watch on the doctrines to ensure they are sound and based on the Word of God, if at all we are to grow in God.</em></li><li><em>It takes time investing ourselves in the Word of God to attain maturity, this calls for patience and not giving up.</em></li><li><em>We are called to grow and reproduce just as bamboo uses energy from existing plant to produce more plants.</em></li><li><em>Maturity duration/periods vary from one Christian to the other depending on the environment one exposes themselves to.</em></li></ol>



<p><strong>Student Y</strong></p>



<p>I studied a beautiful Lillie at our flower bed. Its flowers are white and as they blossom, they brighten the garden making it bright with some level of charm that also infuses some calm.</p>



<p>What I learned.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>1. The plant is a work of God</em></p>



<p><em>&nbsp; 2. It never worries about its tomorrow</em></p>



<p><em>&nbsp; 3. Its flowers sprout and die so that it can grow fresh ones. As a Christian, I have to keep dying to self and allow myself to be recreated into the image of God as I go through the seasons of life. The output will be beautiful and it will result in&nbsp;an&nbsp;infusion of rest and calmness.</em></p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>.</p>



<p>For the Christian, the primary focus of our study is Scripture. Psalm 1:1 reminds us ‘<em>Blessed is the man who meditates on the law of the LORD, day and night</em>.’ We can also use good Christian literature and benefit from the labors of others. In addition to written books, we can pay close attention to ‘non-verbal’ books. Psalm 19 directs us to the&nbsp;<em>wonders of creations as they display God’s glory</em>; in Proverbs 30 we are urged to&nbsp;<em>consider ‘ants, locusts, in the pursuit of wisdom</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take time to study nature,or events or human behaviors and see how much you&#8217;ll learn. For instance, pay attention to nature and see the mysteries of God displayed, study&nbsp;relationships between human beings and see for example how our speech is almost always aimed at justifying our actions because of pride and fear. You will realize that more often than not, you behave more like the Pharisees who would pray, “<em>God I thank thee that I am not like other men</em>.” At this point, make yourself the principal object of study and ask the Lord to deliver you from a haughty spirit.</p>



<p>Every blessing,</p>



<p>Peter Muuo. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p></p>



<p>In 1<sup>st</sup>
Samuel 23: 1-4, David receives news that the country of Keilah was under attack
from the Philistine army. The Philistine army had maliciously attacked and
overpowered Keilah and as a result, they stated looting Keilah’s threshing
floors. Therefore, David did what every Christian believer does, or should do,
when they are under an attack from the enemy; he prayed and inquired of the
Lord. In Vs 2, he asks the Lord, “shall I go and attack these philistines?” and
the Lord answered him and said, “Go, attack the philistines and save Keilah.” </p>



<p>Therefore,
David, full of zeal went and told the 400 men, who had joined him in exile,
what the Lord had just confirmed to him, the victory that they would receive
after they went on a rescue mission to save Keilah from the hand of the
Philistine army. The men were so griped by fear of the “new mission” that David
had told them about that they decided to voice their concern regarding the
danger they faced. </p>



<p>Unfortunately,
they got David’s attention. In Vs 4, David goes back to the Lord to inquire a
second time if He really was going to give them victory if they went up against
the philistine army. </p>



<p>You see,
David only needed a doubtful voice to reach his ear for his faith to be waivered.</p>



<p>As
believers, we always fall victim to this kind of situation. God, by His grace
and love for us, does speak to us through His word, His servants and even in
prayer. He more often than not assures us that we are covered, protected,
blessed, healed and even accepted. Sadly, the people whom we have allowed to be
around us, can sometimes be used of the enemy to bring doubt and crush the
faith that enables us to trust in what God has said about us or to us.</p>



<p>It is good
we allow around us friends who will constantly uplift our faith and help us
grow in our Christian salvation and relationship with God, rather than have
them take us away from God and away from Gods promises and blessings.</p>



<p>Pastor John Hinga.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br></p>



<p>The
devil is seriously waging war on the body of Christ, that is why in 1 Peter 5:8
the bible warns us to- “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil,
as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour”. I am considering
this topic in the wake of Ekeza Sacco scandal in which Bishop. David Kariuki
Ngari alias ‘<em>Gakuyo</em>’ is alleged to
have siphoned Kshs.1.5 billion from the members. </p>



<p>Hardly
a month before, award winning and popular gospel music artists DK Kwenye Beat
and Hopekid were involved in a most scandalous
sex escapade with a young girl; DK was particularly accused of spreading STIs
instead of the gospel. In the recent past the gospel industry has been
especially dogged with many scandals roping in the likes of Willy Paul, Bahati
who succeeded to make the term ‘prayer-partner’ to be a synonym of sex
partner.&nbsp; The phrase may no longer be
used in church anymore because of the unholy connotation it now carries. </p>



<p>When a person becomes famous
for a good and honourable thing in the Kingdom of God; when he builds an
identifiable brand-name and when he makes a significantly large amount in
fortune, then: &nbsp;he needs to become extra
vigilant because there is a fierce lion at his door steps with non-other on earth
to equal him in power. This spiritual lion is perpetually in motion. The day and
night are both alike to him and he has no measure in his furry. When a famous
gospel artist, great worship leader or a crowd pulling and charismatic pastor
are unsuspectingly busking in the fleeting glory of their fame and money; the
lion springs upon them with the object of devouring both the body and the soul
(John 10:10). </p>



<p>The mechanism of their
vulnerability is simple: Money and fame does things to people that make them to
think that life is all about them. We are all vulnerable to this seduction so
much so that I can confidently say that all the above mentioned people had very
noble intentions in the beginning. Over time however, the lion pounded with the
claws of seducing fame and because the pounding does not have real physical
pain at the beginning; they fell victim to the weight of their own fame without
knowing. So much has been the devils influence that in some cases we can say
that the person who was there at the beginning has long since died.</p>



<p>The poignant question is how a poor sinner, who has been carried captive by Satan the roaring lion at his will is to escape out of the snare? After feeding the crowd, Jesus was also pressured by his followers to become King and he fled (John 6:15), he understood it to be Satan’s schemes. In James 4: 7-10 the bible says, “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.” The imperative of the above message to those that have fallen is that they should confess their sins, repent before God of heaven and seek to be forgiven also by their victims. Then in humility go for counselling and accept to be discipled over a reasonable period of time. Then, as God in his sovereign will touches them with healing (with the testimony of transformation from believers in their congregation) they can go back to ministry in their platforms of calling. Failure to which, their further ministry activity will change the way the gospel is seen and will be subjected to ridicule on their account.<br><br><em>Pastor. Davies Kelmen </em></p>

<p class="font_9">It&#8217;s said that silence in the face of evil is evil itself. Not to speak is to speak &amp; not to act is to act. Today, I have been pondering on the current state of affairs in our society and how things have been going south, more specifically with the recent murders. I&#8217;ve been following these stories very closely but today the Lord rebuked me and asked me,what have you done about it? Then as if to argue with Him, I responded, what would I have done? To my amazement, the answer was simple, &#8220;you have been talking about it, sometimes passing judgement but you&#8217;ve never taken time to pray about it.&#8221; I was astonished! I asked God to forgive me and I rem while at the traffic in a matatu, I mentioned the names of all those I could remember, those who have been implicated in one way or the other. I asked that the fear of God would come and grip their hearts and cause them to turn from their ways and follow Christ. Of course, they will still face the consequences of their actions, but for sure, their souls will be saved at the end of time and their testimony will probably lead many other people to salvation.</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Afterwards I felt great relief and thanked God. Now, this might sound absurd but let me bring the point closer home. God says in His Word that in the last days evil will increase. Basically, what we know is that things won&#8217;t get any better. We have our siblings,family, children(or aspiring to have) etc. Let me use the children. Our kids or kids to be will be born to this merciless, cruel, world. If things are bad now, they will be worse in years to come. Wait until the day that such kind of an evil hits your child(GOD FORBID) and that&#8217;s when you will realize the relevance of my prayers today.I want to employ each one of you reading this post. The Bible says, &#8220;the Just shall live by FAITH.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t matter the evil around, the righteous ones will always live because of their Faith in God. Ps 91 speaks about some of the blessings of those who make the Lord their shelter. v7 &#8220;Though a thousand fall at your side, though ten thousand are dying around you, these evils will not touch you.&#8221; Friends, we have a choice today, to go on our knees for our generation.</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Remember, God could have saved Sodom &amp; Gomorrah if He had found just one righteous person. Your prayers and righteousness before God have the potential to turn things around. . You can be the voice that spares your family members from the tragedy that the devil has planned against them.We have a choice to pray that God will preserve them as they come and live in this world that the enemy will not touch them. We have a choice to pray that the fear of the Lord will grip the hearts of men and that perpetrators of evil will come to the saving knowledge of Christ. Friends, we have a choice. You have a choice to panic,complain,fear etc but you also have a choice to pray and make a difference. Prayer works. I employ you to spare some moments and pray for these issues and other issues surrounding your life. James 5:16[NLT], &#8220;The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results.&#8221;</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Make the right choice!</p>

<p class="font_9">In our Bible study, we have been studying the Israelites pilgrimage from Egypt to the promised land. There are many things that we have continued to learn but one thing that has stood out for us is how they had mastered to perfection the art of murmuring. How is it, you ask, that a nation so blessed as Israel could still complain against God? The answer is right before you, ask yourself the same question. Sadly, most people are murmurers(complainers,grumblers), at home,work,school,- everywhere and anytime, there’s always loads of opportunities to grumble. Murmuring is not always verbal, it’s more so in our minds. Murmuring is a sin (Prov 19:3, 17:19) that arises from the fleshly nature of our hearts and it robs us of God’s blessings and grace. For the Israelites, it cost them dearly (Read through Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers and see)</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">The Chronicles of Israel’s murmuring.</p>
<ol class="font_8">
<li>
<p class="font_9">They complained to Moses that because of his talk of a promised land, Pharaoh had made things difficult for them Exodus 5:20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">When pursued by Pharaoh at the Red sea, they complained to Moses that it was better if he had left them alone in Egypt Exodus 14:10-12</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">After experiencing God’s deliverance at the Red sea,  and now at the desert of Shur at a place called Marah, they complained about the bitter water Exodus 15:22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">At the desert of Sin, they complained about being hungry Exodus 16:1-4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">At Rephidin, they complained about being thirsty Exodus 17:1-4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">At the desert of Paran after leaving Sinai, the people complained about their hardships. God sent fire from heaven and consumed the outskirts of the camp. Numbers 11:1-3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The ‘mixed multitude’ amongst the Israelites also complained about not having meat. They said they had lost their appetites because of eating manna continuously-that which previously tasted as honey now tasted like something made with olive oil. Numbers 11:4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Miriam and Aaron complained about Moses’ leadership. Miriam was struck with Leprosy. Numbers 12</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The spies complained about how difficult it was to enter the Promised Land. They died of plague Numbers 14</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The whole assembly wanted to stone Moses Numbers 14:10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Key leaders(Korah,Dathan and Abiran) complained and rebelled against Moses. The ground split open and consumed the rebels. Numbers 16</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">After the episode above, the people complained again accusing Moses of killing God’s people Numbers 16:41</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">At the desert of Zin they complained of thirst and Moses angry with them complained and struck the rock instead of speaking to it. This cost him Canaan. Numbers 20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">The people complained to Moses and God once again for taking them out of Egypt. God sent a fiery serpent to bite them Numbers 21:4-5</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="font_9">Even after experiencing God’s blessings, providence,deliverance,presence and even wrath, the Israelites still grumbled. In 1 Corinthians 10:11, we read that ‘their story is recorded for us to learn from their mistakes’.</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">So what causes murmuring even in us today?</p>
<ol class="font_8">
<li>
<p class="font_9">Comparison. For instance, Numbers 11 “We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic”. Looking at this statement, you’d think their life in Egypt was heaven on earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Self-pity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">A false sense of injustice. (A sense that every circumstance is unfair to you)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Pride. (E.g. Miriam &amp; Aaron)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Lack of gratitude</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Unbelief</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Fear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Being judgmental</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Stubbornness and hardness of heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">Lust</p>
<p class="font_9">
</li>
</ol>

<p class="font_9">1 John 2:15-17</p>
<p class="font_9">In part 1 we saw how our adversary the devil twists our desires to cause us to fall into sin. Now, this guy has been in operation  for a long long time, he is not your friend neither is he your age mate!, he is very good at the game of causing people to fall. Lot in Genesis almost lost his life simply because he chose for himself what looked lucrative without considering the spiritual implications.He became financially prosperous, had worldly status, influence, wealth, and comfort. Yet, it was all taken away in a moment when the judgment of God came upon Sodom and Gomorrah. He put all his eggs in the wrong basket, and lost it all because, ‘the world is passing away!”. Mark 8:36,&#8221;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Eve went after these earthly rewards and it was catastrophic for her, her husband and ultimately the whole world.Genesis 3:6 “When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food [Lust of the flesh] and pleasing to the eye [Lust of the eye] and also desirable for gaining wisdom[Pride of life], she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.”</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Many others fell and still many continue to fall today but thank God for His Son Jesus Christ!! He came, He saw, He conquered the devil. His secret?, The Word of God and being full of the Holy Spirit. All He did was tell the devil, It is written!!! In Matthew 4,  he(the devil) tempted Jesus using the bread for hunger [Lust of the flesh], the Kingdoms of the world [The Lust of the eye] and Protection-Angels coming down to make sure Jesus didn’t fall. This would of course cause anyone to feel awesome about themselves[The Pride of life].</p>
<p class="font_9">
What a perfect example! Like Jesus, we too can use the powerful weapon (The Word of God) and tell the enemy “It is written!”. But how can we do this if we don&#8217;t spend time reading and meditating upon His Word? We find [and I dare say] create a lot of time for useless jokes on social media, current news etc but we are usually too busy for quality time in God&#8217;s presence. What a shame?! The God who has time for each and every one of us yet we don&#8217;t have time for Him? No wonder we are growing cold and cold everyday. &#8220;In the last days, the love of many will grow cold[Matt 24:12].&#8221; It&#8217;s simply as a result of loving the world instead of loving the Word. God have mercy on us.</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">My challenge to you and me.</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">We certainly live in this world and our hearts seek after many things so it goes without saying that the attraction to sin will always be present within us (our desires). Since the biggest area of defilement is in the area of the heart which includes the mind and the will, all these will have to be renewed and transformed by God(His Word and His Spirit). Seeing to it that we are co-workers with Christ, it will also take a deliberate effort from our end to program our thought process around things that are pure,noble,trustworthy,admirable &amp; worthy of praise(Phil 4:8). It must also involve us gaining the courage to face our real selves and taking a hard look at our true motives. (Opening our in most beings to the thorough searching of God). We must let God examine and change our real motives; those hidden drives and dark secrets of our lives must be brought to the light-because God has given us  the power to master them and make a choice to do what is right. Paul says &#8220;Everything is permissible for me&#8221;&#8211;but not everything is beneficial. &#8220;Everything is permissible for me&#8221;&#8211;but I will not be mastered by anything.” My prayer for you and I is that we will master our desires because as it was in the days of Lot, Noah—‘The world will pass away!’. (v.17, Matthew 24:35)</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">More scriptures for your reading &amp; Meditation:</p>
<p class="font_9">
<p class="font_9">Philippians 4:8 &#8220;And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise.&#8221;</p>
<p class="font_9">Psalm 139:23-24 &#8220;Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.24 Point out anything in me that offends you, and lead me along the path of everlasting life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="font_9">Psalm 51:10 &#8220;Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a loyal spirit within me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="font_9">Proverbs 4:23 &#8220;Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.&#8221;</p>
