As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don\u2019t know what has happened to him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">2 Peter 3: 3 \u201cAbove all, you must understand that in the last days\u00a0scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.\u00a0They will say, \u201cWhere is this \u2018coming\u2019 he promised?\u00a0Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Most of us today live reckless lives simply because we think that Jesus Christ has delayed His coming, or worse still, that His coming is just a tale that has been told over the ages. Prov 14:12 \u201cThere is a way that seems right to a man, it leads to destruction\u201d. Our generation is certainly not the first neither the last to be caught up in this trap. Thousands of years ago, the Israelites at Mt. Sinai felt the same towards Moses (their deliverer[savior]) who had stayed 40 days &amp; nights at the mountain top receiving instructions from the Lord. As a result, they went ahead and made themselves an idol, got involved in orgies and other sins. We know that ultimately God was angry with those involved and he struck them with a plague.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">The lesson here is, we are not to lose sight of Jesus\u2019 return. Titus 2:12-13 paraphrased says that we are to live self-controlled,\u00a0upright and godly lives\u00a0in this present age,\u00a0while we wait for the blessed hope\u2014the appearing\u00a0of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. In essence, we are to be found anticipating for Jesus every single day. This will affect everything we say, do, watch, listen etc. If I live my life saying, it might be today that Jesus returns, it might be today when Jesus calls me home, then I will stay alert. Many people have turned themselves to sin because they think that the Lord has delayed His coming. Look at this illustration in the Bible Luke 12:39, if a homeowner knew exactly when a thief was coming, he would not permit his house to be broken into&#8230; Similarly if we lived anticipating\/looking for Jesus, we wouldn\u2019t turn ourselves to sin, we would do everything possible to have a heart after God\u2019s own heart. \u201cAll who have this hope in him purify themselves,\u00a0just as he is pure.\u201d(1 John 3:3). Living with this attitude\/perspective has a purifying effect on our lives.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Matthew 24:42-51, Luke 12:39-46. A faithful servant remains on the job till the master returns. He shall be rewarded greatly. (Jesus Himself will serve him). The evil servant who believes his master has delayed, engages himself in brutality &amp; carnality, will be caught unawares. Shock on him for he will be thrown outside where there\u2019s weeping &amp; gnashing of teeth.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">2 Peter 3:9 \u00a0\u201cThe Lord is not slow in keeping his promise,\u00a0as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient\u00a0with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Let\u2019s be wise like the 5 virgins who had oil in their jars. Even when the bridegroom tarried, they were found ready. \u00a0Keep watch, for you know not the day nor the hour!<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">pmuuo@rogchurchkenya.org\/pmpeacepower@gmail.com<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"comp-jk1c3bq3_SinglePostMediaTop_MediaPost__0_0_def_22_true\" class=\" flex_vbox\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Exodus 32:1 \u201cWhen the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain,\u00a0they gathered around Aaron and said, \u201cCome, make us gods who will go before\u00a0us.
