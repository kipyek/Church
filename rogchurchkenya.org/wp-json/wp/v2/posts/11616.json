Today, covetousness is praised as ambition, greed admired as being industrious, hoarding commended as prudence, premarital sex and extra martial affairs promoted and commended, drunkenness accommodated\u00a0 just to mention a few. Sadly, these and other bad practices take place mostly in Christian circles in the name of grace. That is, christians intentionally commit sin knowing that grace got them covered. I used to think this way too. This is a lie! [Shindwe!]<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Titus 2:11-12 \u201cFor the grace\u00a0of God has appeared\u00a0that offers salvation to all people.\u00a0\u00a0It teaches us to say \u201cNo\u201d to ungodliness and worldly passions,\u00a0and to live self-controlled,\u00a0upright and godly lives\u00a0in this present age.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">In our scripture today, the Bible is bringing it out clearly that the grace\/salvation we enjoy today is given to all men and every man has the opportunity to know God if they choose to. Yet the work of grace is to prevent us from sinning and draws us closer to God. (Not to excuse sin as the world tries to have it)<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Grace is expensive!. It cost Jesus His own life. When I remember the pain, agony, mockery, whipping, crown of thorns, the piercing on his stomach, the nails on His hands and legs, the shame of the cross, the miserable death\u2014all this reminds me that grace is not cheap. Just that thought spurs me to live a godly life, because living in sin is ideally taking Jesus back to the cross.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">So, just because it is free, don\u2019t think for a moment that it won\u2019t cost you something!! That is my definition of grace. Suppose you have a lifelong dream to travel around the world, and someone decides to pay all your bills for that venture __of course, on one hand the trip will be free, you\u2019ll have the time of your life but on the other hand it will cost you something- your time, job, family, friendships and possibly your own life etc. So it is with grace. On the one hand it is a free and undeserved gift, on the other hand, it costs you everything- It requires that I become a disciple of Jesus, loving him more than anything, even my own life and obeying Him faithfully. (Read more in my previous article, Fan or Disciple of Jesus Christ)<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Fellow brothers &amp; sisters in Christ, let\u2019s repent\u00a0of the many instances when we have abused the grace of our Lord Jesus and let\u2019s seek to live faithful, obedient lives that reciprocate His grace for us.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">pmuuo@rogchurchkenya.org; pmpeacepower@gmail.com<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/peter.muuo<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our world is certainly in a bad and sorry state.
