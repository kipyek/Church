In part II, I will seek to point out what salvation is not (a few misconceptions about salvation). To many, salvation is merely a matter of mental acceptance, but they forget what Eph 2:8 says, that salvation is not a product of our works, self-righteousness etc. It\u2019s a gift from God. Let\u2019s look at a few things that salvation is not:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Salvation is not joining the church and being a faithful member. Many are active members in the church yet not members of God\u2019s family.<\/li>\n<li>Salvation is not enlisting in good programs and activities.<\/li>\n<li>Salvation is not volunteering to help the needy.<\/li>\n<li>Salvation is not a new year\u2019s resolution.<\/li>\n<li>Salvation is not taking responsibility to craft our own morality; \u2026 just to mention a few.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Salvation is <strong>needed<\/strong> and <strong>possible to attain<\/strong>. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s <strong><u>available<\/u><\/strong> as long as you still have breath. Salvation will change you from living a guilt-incurring life of sin to living a forgiven life of trust in Christ. To attain it, we must repent our sins and trust in Him (Romans 10:9). Some reading this article have already heard God\u2019s call and felt a desperate need for salvation but haven\u2019t yet made that decision. If that\u2019s you, consider the following passages of scripture;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Romans 13:11-14<\/strong> \u201c<em>This is all the more urgent, for you know how late it is; time is running out. Wake up, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.<\/em><em>\u00a0<strong><sup>12\u00a0<\/sup><\/strong>The night is almost gone; the day of salvation will soon be here. So remove your dark deeds like dirty clothes, and put on the shining armor of right living.\u00a0<strong><sup>13\u00a0<\/sup><\/strong>Because we belong to the day, we must live decent lives for all to see. Don\u2019t participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness, or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living, or in quarreling and jealousy.\u00a0<strong><sup>14\u00a0<\/sup><\/strong>Instead, clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don\u2019t let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>II Peter 3:8-9<\/strong> \u201c<em>But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day.<\/em><em>\u00a0<strong><sup>9\u00a0<\/sup><\/strong>The Lord isn\u2019t really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re the one that God is speaking to through His Word, repeat this simple prayer. \u201cLord Jesus, I acknowledge that I am a sinner, but you died on the cross for my sins. Forgive me today, give me an inheritance in your Kingdom and come and make my heart your home-In Jesus Name.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There you go! You\u2019ve received the promise of <strong>The Unshakable Kingdom<\/strong>!!! Praise God for it and join a God centered-Bible believing church.<\/p>\n<p>May the Lord richly bless you.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Peter Muuo, July 27<sup>th<\/sup> 2018<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PART II: SALVATION; WHAT IT IS NOT In Part I, we looked deeply on what it means to receive salvation.
