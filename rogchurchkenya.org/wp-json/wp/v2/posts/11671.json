The Philistine army had maliciously attacked and\noverpowered Keilah and as a result, they stated looting Keilah\u2019s threshing\nfloors. Therefore, David did what every Christian believer does, or should do,\nwhen they are under an attack from the enemy; he prayed and inquired of the\nLord. In Vs 2, he asks the Lord, \u201cshall I go and attack these philistines?\u201d and\nthe Lord answered him and said, \u201cGo, attack the philistines and save Keilah.\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore,\nDavid, full of zeal went and told the 400 men, who had joined him in exile,\nwhat the Lord had just confirmed to him, the victory that they would receive\nafter they went on a rescue mission to save Keilah from the hand of the\nPhilistine army. The men were so griped by fear of the \u201cnew mission\u201d that David\nhad told them about that they decided to voice their concern regarding the\ndanger they faced. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately,\nthey got David\u2019s attention. In Vs 4, David goes back to the Lord to inquire a\nsecond time if He really was going to give them victory if they went up against\nthe philistine army. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see,\nDavid only needed a doubtful voice to reach his ear for his faith to be waivered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As\nbelievers, we always fall victim to this kind of situation. God, by His grace\nand love for us, does speak to us through His word, His servants and even in\nprayer. He more often than not assures us that we are covered, protected,\nblessed, healed and even accepted. Sadly, the people whom we have allowed to be\naround us, can sometimes be used of the enemy to bring doubt and crush the\nfaith that enables us to trust in what God has said about us or to us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is good\nwe allow around us friends who will constantly uplift our faith and help us\ngrow in our Christian salvation and relationship with God, rather than have\nthem take us away from God and away from Gods promises and blessings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pastor John Hinga.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 1st Samuel 23: 1-4, David receives news that the country of Keilah was under attack from the Philistine army.
