										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My father is a pastor. When my niece was young, pre-school, he’d tell her, “Finish your tea or you’ll die”. (The things we say to get our kids to hurry up and finish eating). I’m not sure she understood the concept of death; she just knew it was something bad. It went on for a while until one day she responded with a question: “Does God drink tea?”</p>
<p>You could see the theological wheels turning in my father’s brain as he searched for an answer&#8230;If I say Yes, I’ll be lying&#8230;but if I say No&#8230;where will this conversation go&#8230;? He decided to go with “No, God does not drink tea.”</p>
<p>Without missing a beat after swallowing her mouthful of tea, my niece responded, “He’ll die.” Suffice it to say, my dad learned to be more realistic and truthful about his urgings and warnings.</p>
<p>This incident came to mind as I was thinking about truth, who God is and who we believe He is.</p>
<p>It’s been said that we are living in a post-truth world. The Cambridge Dictionary defines “Post-truth” as “relating to a situation in which people are more likely to accept an argument based on their emotions and beliefs, rather than one based on facts.</p>
<p>Many people today, both Christians and non-Christians believe in an (their) idea of Jesus rather than on Jesus Himself. We have this idea of a hippy-make-love-not-war-Jesus or activist-Jesus or my-next-door-buddy-Jesus or my-ATM-Jesus or Fire-fighter-Jesus or safe-Jesus or even put-one-foot-wrong-and-you-are-dead-Jesus. All caricatures; not the real Jesus.</p>
<p>Yet Truth is not an idea or a concept, but a person. Jesus said, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by Me.” (John 14:6) If the Truth is a person, then the only way we can know Truth is through relationship. Truth is not a thing we look for but a Person we get to know, listen to and obey.</p>
<p>Infact Jesus said He came to seek and to save the lost (Luke 19:10). He has done the work. It is finished. But our fallen nature wants to earn its own way into God’s Kingdom. We don’t want to come in through relationship; we want to come in through merit.</p>
<p>Truth can be known, if we are willing to lay down our ideas and meet Him on His own terms.</p>
<p>When Job met Him, his response was: “My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.” (Job 42:5)</p>
<p>When Isaiah met Him, his response was: “Woe to me! I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty.” (Isaiah 6:5)</p>
<p>When Peter met Him, his response was: “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” Then he left everything and followed Him. (Luke 5:8, 11)</p>
<p>When Thomas finally “met” Him, his response was: “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28)</p>
<p>What is the starting point of meeting this Jesus?</p>
<p>Jesus said; “Now this is eternal life: that they may know you the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.” (John 17:3)</p>
<p>Jesus is Love, Just, Kind, Meek, Humble, Caring, Compassionate and He is also Righteous, Holy, Lord, Judge and King.<br />
We do well to come to Him on His terms.</p>
<p>This Jesus says:<br />
“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by Me.” (John 14:6)</p>
<p>“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)</p>
<p>“All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.” (John 14:23)</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. (Matthew 10:28)</p>
<p>A.W. Tozer says, “What I believe about God is the most important thing about me.”</p>
<p>What do you believe about God?<br />
What are you basing your beliefs on?<br />
His revelation of Himself or your emotions and personal beliefs?</p>
<p>These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules. (Matthew 15:8-9)</p>
<p>Today as we spend time with in God’s presence, may we embrace true eternal life as we cultivate relationship with the One true God and Jesus Christ, the Truth, whom He has sent.</p>
<p>To all who received Him, to those who believed on His name, He gave the right to become children of God. (John 1:12)<br />
That’s relationship!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been in a place where what the Bible says and your reality seems to be at odds?</p>
<p>And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.” Matt 21:22<br />
I believe&#8230;why isn’t God answering my prayer?</p>
<p>And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 1 John 5:14<br />
My prayer lines up with God’s will&#8230;why isn’t He answering?</p>
<p>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. James 4:3<br />
If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened&#8230;Psalm 66:18<br />
My motives are pure; my sins are confessed&#8230;why isn’t God answering?</p>
<p>That’s where Job found himself.</p>
<p>He was suffering terribly and God was silent.<br />
It felt like God was punishing him for something&#8230;</p>
<p>His friends were sure he had sinned<br />
Job was certain he hadn’t<br />
Job was the kind of man who offered sacrifices for his children&#8230;just in case they had sinned&#8230;he kept short accounts with God where sin was concerned.</p>
<p>Job took his situation to God&#8230;<br />
I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul (Job 7:11)<br />
Will you never look away from me, or let me alone for an instant? If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why do you make me your target? (Job 7:19-20)<br />
I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul. I will say to God: Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me. (Job 10:1-2)</p>
<p>Job’s words are raw, pouring out his heart and questioning why. He may have even overstepped some boundaries with his words but God was not offended by his honesty. God admonished him for speaking “words without knowledge” (Job 38:1 – 41:34 a long and scary lecture) and Job repented (42:1-6).</p>
<p>God then turns and rebukes Job’s friends “I am angry with you&#8230;because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has&#8230;”</p>
<p>Job never got an answer from God on why he went through such great suffering, but God did wipe Job’s tears at the end. (42:10-16)</p>
<p>We have the privilege of being in the audience as we see what takes place between God and Satan. Job didn’t.</p>
<p>Job had faith; he was asking for a good thing and he hadn’t sinned.</p>
<p>God was actually showing off Job’s uprightness to Satan.</p>
<p>As long as we are on this side of eternity, things will happen.<br />
We may suffer because of the fallenness of the world we live in.<br />
We may suffer as a consequence of our sin or poor choices&#8230;or&#8230;<br />
We may just suffer for reasons unknown to us.</p>
<p>Our peace in suffering comes from knowing that<br />
• our loving God is Sovereign over all that happens to us<br />
• He sees us and is aware of what we are going through<br />
• He has a reason why, which He may choose to let us in on, or not<br />
He is with us and He is not leaving (Hebrews 13:5)</p>
<p>Spending time in God’s Word and seeing how He deals with His people, helps us have faith in His power and goodness. It helps us know His character and reminds us that He is a God that can be trusted.</p>
<p>As you spend time with God today, be honest with Him. If things are going well, rejoice with Him, if things are falling apart, pour out your heart to Him, if you are in a dark valley, tell him. Let Him be your comfort. Let Him be your strong tower. Let Him be your joy and your salvation. He will wipe away your tears&#8230;now or later&#8230;</p>
<p>These (the heroes of faith) were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect. (Hebrews 11:39-40)</p>

<p class="font_9">My name is Peter Muuo, of course many of you reading this know that. I am one of those persons who really value their reputation. I will do everything possible to safeguard my image. Recently as we were commuting home, my wife offered me a drink of porridge which I quickly turned down. It was a simple No, thanks! She wasn’t shocked, as she would later confirm to me that her gesture was just an act of  kindness, otherwise having known me for quite some time now, she knew beforehand that I wasn’t going to accept her offer[Me, taking porridge, in a matatu!No way!]. Mind you, not that anyone would have noticed.</p>
<p class="font_9">This need to feel dignified might not necessarily be a bad thing, but if not put in check, I acknowledge that it can puff me up in many ways and to admit it, it has, in several occasions. For instance, it was so bad at some point in my life that I only desired to be associated with the high and mighty, only those that I could gain something from in return(E.g. fame by hanging out with celebrities, financial benefits etc.). The Lord seriously rebuked me through my wife (fiancé then), [story for another day] and now by the grace of God, I daily ask God to help me appreciate everyone that comes into my life and treat them equally.</p>
<p class="font_9">Pride is a snare that the devil has used successfully since the creation of the world to bring destruction upon people. John Hagee quotes, “Pride is like a poisonous weed that grows in any soil without need of water or care.” No one is immune from it, it’s like a cancer that kills everyone and everything it touches.</p>
<p class="font_9">Our text from Proverbs 16:18 goes on to say, “Pride goes before destruction,<br />
a haughty spirit before a fall.” Pride always precedes destruction and a great fall.</p>
<p class="font_9">What is Pride and what causes it?</p>
<p class="font_9">Among other things, pride is first and foremost a spirit, [read v.18b—a haughty spirit]. It lifts us up so that we look down on someone or people just because we feel we are better than them. The source of this spirit is the devil himself. It was because of pride that him and the fallen angels were thrown out of heaven [Isaiah 14:12-15, Rev 12:7-12] He fell because of pride that originated from his desire to be God instead of a servant of God. Satan was the highest of all the angels [Ez 28:12-19], but he wasn’t happy. He desired to be God and rule the universe. God cast Satan out of heaven as a fallen angel.</p>
<p class="font_9">Pride is the spiritual power behind broken families, churches, governments and the society at large. Marriages break up mainly because of pride(No one is willing to admit their mistake); the body of Christ is sharply divided because we don’t embrace each other(some denominations feel superior than others, some pastors preach messages that are only meant to attract followers[&amp; sycophants] to build their reputation rather than preaching what’s true and to win souls.)</p>
<p class="font_9">Secondly, I’d say that pride is deeply rooted in idolatry- It causes people to worship themselves (e.g. Have you seen people who worship their beauty?), worship others, their possessions and abilities etc.  It makes people think that they are self-sufficient and that they don’t need no one, not even God, because they themselves have become gods. I have sometimes read about some people who call themselves gods because they pride themselves in their wealth &amp; abilities. Pharaoh is a perfect example. In Exodus 5:2, he asks Moses, “Who is the Lord? And why should I listen to Him? I don’t know the Lord and I will not let Israel go”. The rich fool in Luke 12:13-21, beat his chest for having plenty, he thought he now held the keys to his life &amp; future. God took his life that very night.</p>
<p class="font_9">More examples in the Bible</p>
<p class="font_9">There are endless examples in scripture about people who became proud and ended in destruction. I’ve mentioned some above, let’s see a few more:</p>
<ol class="font_8">
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s pride that caused Adam &amp; Eve to sin against God. Eve desired wisdom (to become like God) and that’s why she ate the fruit in the first place. When God confronted them with their sin, they couldn’t help but blame each other instead of simply accepting responsibility for their actions. In fact at one point Adam blamed God for creating the woman and giving her to him. [Seriously!!]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s pride that caused Cain to kill Abel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s pride that sent king Nebuchadnezzar to the fields to eat grass for 7 years while he should have been in his palace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s pride that orchestrated the downfall of most Kings of Israel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s this same spirit that caused the Israelites to worship other Gods. (Remember the warning in Deuteronomy 8 “Beware in your plenty that you do not forget the Lord your God). But they often forgot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It’s the self-righteous pride of the Pharisees that made them not accept the testimony of Jesus, ultimately crucifying him on the cross.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_9">It was by the same spirit that one of the thieves on the cross blatantly refused the supremacy of Jesus Christ (Luke 23:39). Even today, this Spirit is at work causing people to deny even the existence of Christ.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="font_9">I do not know where you are at in your life. As I mentioned earlier, pride is a serious destroyer and all of us are her candidates. In our arrogant pride we are telling God that we don’t need Him. Working on pride is not a day’s activity, it’s a life time event that involves the daily work of the Holy Spirit. Has it touched your life, family, church? Allow God through His Holy Spirit to get it out now because your very spiritual survival is at stake. Remember that no proud man/woman can stand before God. James 4:6.  “And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” I need this grace, we all do. Let’s say a prayer together:</p>
<p class="font_9">Father in Heaven, I thank you for your Word that has reminded me today that pride is a dangerous poison. Forgive me Lord when I have allowed it to ruin my life, my family, my work and my relationship with you. Father I ask for your grace that is freely available to all, to rest on me today, to help me live a life of humility before God and men. I acknowledge that the process of teaching me humility may not be a sweet one, but dear Lord, I am ready, for I know that you chasten those that you love. So help me God, and let your Holy Spirit richly dwell in my life. In Jesus Name I pray.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Exodus 32:1 “When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="comp-jk1c3bq3_SinglePostMediaTop_MediaPost__0_0__type_MediaPost" class=" flex_vbox">
<div id="5b8664363edd481a9844fa87comp-jk1c3bq3_SinglePostMediaTop_MediaPost__0_0_mediaText" class="s_usaAWRichTextClickableSkin" data-packed="false" data-proxy-name="MediaLabel" data-width="930">

<p class="font_9">Exodus 32:1 “When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.”</p>
<p class="font_9">2 Peter 3: 3 “Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.”</p>
<p class="font_9">Most of us today live reckless lives simply because we think that Jesus Christ has delayed His coming, or worse still, that His coming is just a tale that has been told over the ages. Prov 14:12 “There is a way that seems right to a man, it leads to destruction”. Our generation is certainly not the first neither the last to be caught up in this trap. Thousands of years ago, the Israelites at Mt. Sinai felt the same towards Moses (their deliverer[savior]) who had stayed 40 days &amp; nights at the mountain top receiving instructions from the Lord. As a result, they went ahead and made themselves an idol, got involved in orgies and other sins. We know that ultimately God was angry with those involved and he struck them with a plague.</p>
<p class="font_9">The lesson here is, we are not to lose sight of Jesus’ return. Titus 2:12-13 paraphrased says that we are to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. In essence, we are to be found anticipating for Jesus every single day. This will affect everything we say, do, watch, listen etc. If I live my life saying, it might be today that Jesus returns, it might be today when Jesus calls me home, then I will stay alert. Many people have turned themselves to sin because they think that the Lord has delayed His coming. Look at this illustration in the Bible Luke 12:39, if a homeowner knew exactly when a thief was coming, he would not permit his house to be broken into&#8230; Similarly if we lived anticipating/looking for Jesus, we wouldn’t turn ourselves to sin, we would do everything possible to have a heart after God’s own heart. “All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.”(1 John 3:3). Living with this attitude/perspective has a purifying effect on our lives.</p>
<p class="font_9">Matthew 24:42-51, Luke 12:39-46. A faithful servant remains on the job till the master returns. He shall be rewarded greatly. (Jesus Himself will serve him). The evil servant who believes his master has delayed, engages himself in brutality &amp; carnality, will be caught unawares. Shock on him for he will be thrown outside where there’s weeping &amp; gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="font_9">2 Peter 3:9  “The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.”</p>
<p class="font_9">Let’s be wise like the 5 virgins who had oil in their jars. Even when the bridegroom tarried, they were found ready.  Keep watch, for you know not the day nor the hour!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="font_9">LUKE 14:25-35</p>
<p class="font_9">V.25 “A large crowd was following Jesus …”</p>
<p class="font_9">This was a typical day in Jesus’ life during His earthly ministry- He had many fans. Some were dazzled by His amazing miracles, others entertained by His captivating miracles, still others were impressed by how cleverly He refuted the challenges of the Pharisees and other religious leaders. Jesus was popular. The Nation was looking for a charismatic leader who would help overthrow the Roman authorities—and here was someone superbly qualified for the task. All He needed to do was flatter them, probably perform a few miracles to win their allegiance etc., but Jesus took the exact opposite approach (Opposite of what most preaching is concerned with today).</p>
<p class="font_9">Instead of majoring in the benefits and blessings, thrills and excitements, Jesus spoke more of the difficulties, the dangers, the sacrifices they’d have to make-to become His disciples. He was not interested in mere quantity, He was looking for men and women of quality. This is what puts a distinction between a fan and a follower. Fans tag along during the good times, watch events from the sidelines but followers of Jesus proactively pursue becoming like their Master in every way. No wonder Jesus gave the command to His disciples to “Go and make ‘Disciples’ of all nations. (Matthew 28:19). Note that He didn’t tell them to go and make church goers, Christians, believers-He was specific, Disciples. “It is not without significance that the word disciple occurs in the new testament 269 times, Christian only 3 times and believers 2 times” (Sanders 1994)</p>
<p class="font_9">Jesus continues to have many fans today. The church is full of people who see Jesus as their quick-fix solution to their troubled marriages, financial difficulties, health problems etc. Similarly the church is full of many preachers whose gospel is about blessings, money, healing, wealth and health thus attracting many fans. As my pastor would put it, “The gospel of Jesus Christ is not about shillings and cents, it’s about heaven and hell, righteousness and unrighteousness.” True to this proclamation, I submit to you that Jesus is engaged in a serious agenda of destroying the Kingdom of darkness &amp; He doesn’t desire to be associated with people who will slow down His agenda or who will turn back when the fighting grows fierce.</p>
<p class="font_9">When you made that decision to follow Christ, did you count the cost?</p>
<p class="font_9">God bless you!</p>
