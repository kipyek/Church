I am one of those persons who really value\u00a0their\u00a0reputation. I will do everything possible to safeguard my image. Recently as we were commuting home, my wife offered me a drink of porridge which I quickly turned down. It was a simple No, thanks! She wasn\u2019t shocked, as she would later confirm to me that her gesture was just an act of\u00a0 kindness, otherwise having known me for quite some time now, she knew beforehand that I wasn\u2019t going to accept her offer[Me, taking porridge, in a matatu!No way!]. Mind you, not that anyone would have noticed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">This need to feel dignified might not necessarily be a bad thing, but if not put in check, I acknowledge that it can puff me up in many ways and to admit it, it has, in several occasions. For instance, it was so bad at some point in my life that I only desired to be associated with the high and mighty, only those that I could gain something from in return(E.g. fame by hanging out with celebrities, financial benefits etc.). The Lord seriously rebuked me through my wife (fianc\u00e9 then), [story for another day] and now by the grace of God, I daily ask God to help me appreciate everyone that comes into my life and treat them equally.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Pride is a snare that the devil has used successfully since the creation of the world to bring destruction upon people.\u00a0John Hagee quotes, \u201cPride is like a poisonous weed that grows in any soil without need of water or care.\u201d No one is immune from it, it\u2019s like a cancer that kills everyone and everything it touches.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Our text from Proverbs 16:18 goes on to say, \u201cPride\u00a0goes before destruction,<br \/>\na haughty spirit\u00a0before a fall.\u201d Pride always precedes destruction and a great fall.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">What is Pride and what causes it?<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Among other things, pride is first and foremost a\u00a0spirit, [read v.18b\u2014a haughty spirit]. It lifts us up so that we look down on someone or people just because we feel we are better than them. The source of this spirit is the devil himself. It was because of pride that him and the fallen angels were thrown out of heaven [Isaiah 14:12-15, Rev 12:7-12] He fell because of pride that originated from his desire to be God instead of a servant of God. Satan was the highest of all the angels [Ez 28:12-19], but he wasn\u2019t happy. He desired to be God and rule the universe. God cast Satan out of heaven as a fallen angel.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Pride is the spiritual power behind broken families, churches, governments and the society at large. Marriages break up mainly because of pride(No one is willing to admit their mistake); the body of Christ is sharply divided because we don\u2019t embrace each other(some denominations feel superior than others, some pastors preach messages that are only meant to attract followers[&amp; sycophants] to build their reputation rather than preaching what\u2019s true and to win souls.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Secondly, I\u2019d say that pride is deeply rooted in\u00a0idolatry- It causes people to worship themselves (e.g. Have you seen people who worship their beauty?), worship others, their possessions and abilities etc. \u00a0It makes people think that they are self-sufficient and that they don\u2019t need no one, not even God, because they themselves have become gods. I have sometimes read about some people who call themselves gods because they pride themselves in their wealth &amp; abilities. Pharaoh is a perfect example. In Exodus 5:2, he asks Moses, \u201cWho is the Lord? And why should I listen to Him? I don\u2019t know the Lord and I will not let Israel go\u201d. The rich fool in Luke 12:13-21, beat his chest for having plenty, he thought he now held the keys to his life &amp; future. God took his life that very night.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">More examples in the Bible<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">There are endless examples in scripture about people who became proud and ended in destruction. I\u2019ve mentioned some above, let\u2019s see a few more:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"font_8\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"font_9\">It\u2019s pride that caused Adam &amp; Eve to sin against God. Eve desired wisdom (to become like God) and that\u2019s why she ate the fruit in the first place. When God confronted them with their sin, they couldn\u2019t help but blame each other instead of simply accepting responsibility for their actions. In fact at one point Adam blamed God for creating the woman and giving her to him. [Seriously!!]<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"font_9\">It\u2019s pride that caused Cain to kill Abel.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"font_9\">It\u2019s pride that sent king Nebuchadnezzar to the fields to eat grass for 7 years while he should have been in his palace.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"font_9\">It\u2019s pride that orchestrated the downfall of most Kings of Israel.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"font_9\">It\u2019s this same spirit that caused the Israelites to worship other Gods. (Remember the warning in Deuteronomy 8 \u201cBeware in your plenty that you do not forget the Lord your God). But they often forgot<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"font_9\">It\u2019s the self-righteous pride of the Pharisees that made them not accept the testimony of Jesus, ultimately crucifying him on the cross.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"font_9\">It was by the same spirit that one of the thieves on the cross blatantly refused the supremacy of Jesus Christ (Luke 23:39). Even today, this Spirit is at work causing people to deny even the existence of Christ.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"font_9\">I do not know where you are at in your life. As I mentioned earlier, pride is a serious destroyer and all of us are her candidates. In our arrogant pride we are telling God that we don\u2019t need Him. Working on pride is not a day\u2019s activity, it\u2019s a life time event that involves the daily work of the Holy Spirit. Has it touched your life, family, church? Allow God through His Holy Spirit to get it out now because your very spiritual survival is at stake. Remember that no proud man\/woman can stand before God. James 4:6. \u00a0\u201cAnd he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say, \u201cGod opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\u201d I need this grace, we all do. Let\u2019s say a prayer together:<\/p>\n<p class=\"font_9\">Father in Heaven, I thank you for your Word that has reminded me today that pride is a dangerous poison. Forgive me Lord when I have allowed it to ruin my life, my family, my work and my relationship with you. Father I ask for your grace that is freely available to all, to rest on me today, to help me live a life of humility before God and men. I acknowledge that the process of teaching me humility may not be a sweet one, but dear Lord, I am ready, for I know that you chasten those that you love. So help me God, and let your Holy Spirit richly dwell in my life. In Jesus Name I pray.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Proverbs 16:18 My name is Peter Muuo, of course many of you reading this know that.
